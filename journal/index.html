<h2>2017</h2>

<div class="card">
<h3>AUGUST 2017</h3>

	<h4>8/17/17</h4>
	Watching: Seinfeld

	Stupid craving for beef jerky today so went to kram over lunch to get some.. tried to bike back with a fountain soda in hand. Successful but was not graceful.

	Started fall softball Thursday night league. Played the Punks, lost one and tied. 


	8/18/17
	Listening: Murder By Death - Al Boca
	Watching: Bitcoin Documentary / Blade

	Walk to the grocery store on a nice night. Homemade pizza Friday night. Fathead chicken alfredo and a bbq. 

	Ate our weight in Kramarczuks beef jerky the past two days. 1lb/25$ worth. So fucking delicious.

	"The best thing about homemade pizza is that you can push as much sauce on it as you want" - Lacey

	8/19/2017
	Kubb in the backyard with David, Matt, Eli. Perfect day. David mentioned the episode of "Why was this made?" (which is about why shitty movies were made) that the movie Garbage Pail kids, looking for a substitute for the word 'bullshit' ended at 'dog squeeze'... 5 min later he grabbed a kubb dowel with dogshit on it.

	"So are man buns just not a thing anymore?" - Matt

	"That's a good old one (old fashioned)" - Matt

	"Oh my Jupiter" - David
	 
	Tattersall Martinis > Vegas Lounge Pool > Butcher & the boar stolen TP > Mackenzie's for food

	Paris 97 - Eiffel 75 - Eli

	8/19

	Red cow brunch and an afternoon nap

	8/20 

	Solar eclipse today, was a bit lackluster due to the cloudy conditions so not much was seen around the Minneapolis area. Post work volleyball vs Gin Camels, won all 3

	8/21

	8/22

	Lacey flew out to North Carolina for work today so I'm living the bachelor life. Played some rocket league with David and biked to uptown to meet up with Ryan, Brett, and Eli. Watched them play a song they wrote in the attic of the Green Giant and played some foosball. Then off to Muddy waters for some apps and beers. Likely one of the last times us 3 will get to hang out for a long time. Going away party for Eli on Friday.

	8/23

	Eli's going away party was a success. Lot's of familiar faces. Rumplemintz to start the night. Made a quick trip to Clarkson's with him, KT, and Eli in the rain for some lines. 

	Used Foosball as an excuse to be anti social to the best of my ability per usual.

	Crashed at Ryan and Brett's like old times sake.

	Vingavorken

	Flesh Bandicoot

	8/24

	Extremely hungover. Took the bus home while the rest of them went to Red Cow for brunch. I ordered Pho from Lien Son and napped the rainy Saturday away. David came by later in the night for some beers, brats, and rocket league.

	8/25

	Another lazy Sunday of naps. Passed on some invites to go see Bloodnstuff and Self Evident at Bauhaus. Just waiting for Lacey to get home to be a couch potato with me.

	8/26

	Work is getting better, I'm starting to grasp PHP, Wordpress, ACF, Flexbox, GIT, Flywheel, MySQL. Took a few weeks but it's starting to click. Every day is better than the last. 

	Lunchtime jog around Nicollet island, pretty sluggish after the binge eating/drinking all weekend. 

	Lacey gets home tonight after volleyball :)

	8/31

	Eli's last night in town.

	Red Dragon wonderous punch with Lacey and David. Libra's unite!

	Rudolphs wings after some NBA Jam at Morts with Lacey, David, Joe, Eukay, and Eli's old coworker Sam

	Ended night after some drinks at nightingales at the CC Club for one last hoorah.

<h3>SEPTEMBER 2017</h3>

	9/1

	Built to Spill
	"Life goes on even after the thrill of living is gone"

	Parents coming to town today so spending the morning cleaning. 

	Hoping to take them to Psycho Susie's and maybe take them on a bike ride 

	- David came over and played kubb with mom, dad, and lacey for a bit and then we took them on a bike ride down st Anthony main and stone arch, along the river and up to suzies. We got some appetizers and tiki drinks and then made our way over to the Smack Shack for dinner. Lobster rolls and oysters for mom dad and I and a Cuban for a Lacey

	9/2

	State fair with the parents. Mom loved it but dad wasn't a fan as I'd predicted he wouldn't be. He never has been one for crowds. We tried some of the new foods this year.. maple nitro cold press from farmers union, duck bacon wontons + dill pickle beer + maple bacon beer from Giggles. The lines were stupid long and I think we were all growing increasingly impatient.

	Rode the ferries wheel, watched some trick dogs, took mom on the tilt a whirl (she said its been her favorite ride since grandpa Goos used to take her on it when she was young, she had a blast), and we did the water ride (followed by a trashy inline display of pda) where mom ended up losing her sun glasses clip on. 

	Took them to JL Beers for a night cap dinner.

	9/4

	Labor Day, day off. Had some coffee and chatted a bit with mom and dad before they took off back home.

	Lacey and I biked to Tilt in uptown to play some pinball and found some margaritas afterwards. Then made a stop at the Asian market and lunds on the way home.

	Homemade pizza and Addams family.

	"Gomezzzz"

	9/5 - Tuesday

	Brett interviewed at rocket today for a jr copyrighter position.. doesn't quite have the experience but it sounds like they're having him back for a second round.

	Post work happy hour at Moose with David and a 10 minute game of cricket before the softball double header.

	9/6 - Wednesday

	Short day at work today, flying out to Seattle this afternoon! 

	Fireball preflight ritual. Had a connecting flight in Denver and luckily got to fly standby shaving off two hours of our trip time. Got into Seattle around d 7:30 UTC, bussed to downtown and Ubered to our airbnb (a quaint, modern little studio apartment with concrete floors and abstract decor). 

	1206 E Barclays Ct Unit A

	We were both wiped and famished from our trip; for convenience sake we ordered some pizza (chicken alfredo which was actually really good) from a place called Palermo's and watched some Anthony Bourdain to try and hone up on our Seattle knowledge before submersing ourselves in the city.

	"Double check your seat belts, the captain said he's going to try something he saw in the movies last week" - Flight attendant

	9/7 - Thursday

	Woke up at 5:30, the time change is really throwing me off. Going to head out soon to check out some touristy spots in downtown.

	Tentative itinerary thus far:
	- Elm coffee 
	- Gum Wall
	- Pike Place Market
	    - Explored the market and got to try some of the best fresh salmon I've ever had. Witnessed a fish toss so I think we're technically locals. 
	- Space Needle
	    - Definitely worth seeing, the view was pretty incredible but due to the wildfires the haze was thick and we weren't able to see mount ranier. We did have a good view of Puget Sound though. To note: it smelled overwhelmingly of popcorn up there.
	- Pho Than Brothers - Queen Anne's
	    - Maybe the best pho we've ever had, definitely gives Quang's a run for their money
	- Shorty's Bar
	    - This was a cool little Coney Island themed dive bar and pinball arcade (pinball cove) with a large number of clown memorabilia and old pinball machines as booth tables. Mane IPA, pinball cove, Addams family, pinball machine tables, Johnny ju, and a pinball machine called safecracker that spits out 2 for 1 drink tokens
	- Ivar's - clam chowder
	- Ferry to Bainbridge Island
	    - We hopped on the 30min ferry to Bainbridge and checked out the cool little island town. We were both pretty tired from the day of walking so we didn't see as much as we'd have liked to but it was still really cool. Ended up popping into a little book/record shop, bought a couple of books, and headed back to Seattle. Coming in, the view of the cityscape and the cool breeze was really memorable. From there we retraced our steps back to the air bnb to total over 10 miles of walking throughout the day..
	- Ezell's Chicken

	9/8 - Friday

	65 degrees and overcast.

	Another early morning; getting ready to explore the international district a little and then make it up to Capital Hill today and potentially a Mariner's game this evening. 

	- Bike + Coffee shop
	- Uwajiwaya Japanese market in China Town. Got some sushi and ate in a little Asian themed court yard. Still 2 hours until the pinball museum opens so we walked around trying to find a Bloody Mary.. people definitely don't drink here like they do in the Midwest. So many coffee shops, almost a comical amount. There seems to be at least one on every block and they all seem to be full. 
	- Found an open bar, firefighter themed, bloodies secured. McCoys Firehouse
	- Made it to the pinball museum right as they opened and started with some of the older machines. As it started filling up it grew increasingly loud and warm so we left after an hour and a half. Lacey likes to think she got thrown out for disorderly conduct for trying to step out for fresh air. Back to the abb for a nap.
	- Uber up to capital hill for a nice cocktail at Sun Liqour and then some quick tacos at taco cuckis/a hamburger from dicks. Took the food to go and ate in Cal Anderson Park by the reflecting pool. Once we were done snarfing down the food we headed to Safeco Field for the Mariners/Angels game. 
	- Nothing super notable about the game, it was a nice cool night and we weren't particularly interested in the game but we did see a three run homer followed by fireworks so that was cool. Other than that we kind of explored the stadium and then just headed back to get some sleep after the 7th inning.

	9/9 Saturday

	Cloudy and cool

	Spent the day with Avery and Sam.

	Met up with them for brunch at a converted old firehouse called Hi Life. 

	- Checked out their apartment and watched their dog Rocky chase a fly.
	- Ballard Locks - watched a sea lion massacre a few salmon
	- Brewery hopped around Ballard - Ruebens, 
	    - "Badabing Butterbean"
	- Ate some delicious food at the oyster bar The Walrus & The Carpenter

	10/10 - Sunday

	Sunny and 70's

	Got some coffee at Stumptown and walked up to volunteer park with Lacey. Found a dugout full of weed on the way. 
	Walked through the Lakeview Cemetery and saw Bruce/Brandon Lee's gravesite. 

	Optimism brewery. Nap. Shorties.

	Mac DeMarco at the Moore theater, third row. Was awesome to begin but he got wasted on a half bottle of Jameson and borderline annoying towards the end.

	10/11 - Monday

	Caught a 7:30 flight to head home. Long day of travel followed by volleyball. 

	Appropriately finished Frasier on the plane back to Mpls. 

	10/12 - Tues

	Both of us still trying to recover from the trip.. I took the night off from softball and we made homemade pho.

	10/13

	Still another day of vacation recovery, got to bed early.

	10/15 - Friday

	Lacey and my 4th year anniversary today. Can't believe it's been so long, feels like these years have flown by.

	House warming party tonight for David Soiseth and Sam. Nice little place on the adjacent block of Lacey's first mpls apt (36th and Grand).

	David showed me his hot sauce collection and sent me home with a homemade batch.

	Me - seemingly normal on the exterior but constantly struggling.

	9/16 - Saturday

	Biked downtown to meet up with mom, Karen, and Laurie for brunch at Rock Bottom before they went to the Aladdin musical.

	Went to St Anthony Main theater to see IT, Lacey tougher it out and actually liked it.

	Acme theater to see Anthony Davito and then to Cuzzie's for Ashley's work-going away party. Was a lot of fun until she got too drunk and started puking on herself. She was an  emotional wreck; her brother had just tried to commit suicide earlier in the week.

	9/17 - Sunday

	Lazy morning, homemade eggs benedict followed by a nap.

	NHL '18

	9/18 - Monday

	Long day at work; continuously getting longer due to the enforced mandatory 8.5 workday/half hour lunch. 

	At least Matt gave us a ride to volleyball.. 
	we stayed after our double header, Victor Shores just so happened to be playing at Memory Lanes for "punk and bowl Monday's". I've probably seen them upwards of 15-20 times but I always get the same feeling of nostalgia and happiness when I do get to see them. 
	 
	"I'm not sure of myself but I'm sure of my problems"

	9/19 - Tues

	Softball is done for the season, finally a night to sit back and chill. Quesadillas and Seinfeld.

	My great grandfather was actually a slave

	9/22 - Friday

	Lacey had a 'girls night out' so I had a few dudes over, David, Ryan, Brett, and Michael. Hung around the house for a bit and then biked to dangerous man for some peanut butter porters.

	9/22 - Saturday

	Dignan/Leetal's wedding in Plymouth at her family home. 90 degree outdoor wedding, so much sweat. Was a really nice  setup though, burger bar for dinner and cocktails from Norseman.. the Gin/lemon/simple syrup/grapefruit bitters was amazing. Hung out for a bit, lost steam and chilled on a nice rocking bench under the  string lights before we ubered back.

	Hungarian ballerina boy.

	9/23 - Sunday

	Played volleyball at Theodore Wirth for 4 hours - matt, David, Woody, Michael, ryan, brett, marilea 

	Out to new Bohemia with David for a HH before home to make BBQ chicken homemade pizza with lacey, I think this was the best one yet!

	9/24 - Monday

	Volleyball in the rain against balls deep, yet again we lost to them.

	9/25 - Tuesday

	Work/NHL/leftovers/American vandal/repeat

	9/26

	Woken up by the cats and couldn't get back to sleep. Headed to work early, 7:30. Almost done with my first website design/build!

	9/27

	So much brain fog and anxiety today. I just want to run away from every social interaction. Can't concentrate whatsoever. 3 more hours and I'll be home with Lacey, the cats, and homemade ramen. WISHMELUCK

	9/28 - Friday

	Bags tournament after work at R55, was pretty weak and unorganized but won it nonetheless. 

	Spent the night at home with Lacey.

	9/29

	Lacey and I biked to brunch at Grumpy's downtown where I got the most disappointing chicken wings I think I've had. Popped into the book store nearby to checkout the Minneapolis Zine Fest; there was a lot of cool material but it was super packed and we felt claustrophobic and awkward so we dipped. Headed home and spent the rest of the day at home. Made a trip to McDonalds and binge watched Ozark.

	9/30 - Sun

	Took our dirty ass broken car to cub to grocery shop. It was crazy busy and our cashier was clipping her nails on the job. Made it out and spent a good portion of the day meal prepping some breakfast burritos, chili, and breaded Mac ncheese. 

	Tacos and Ozark

<h3>OCTOBER 2017</h3>

	10/2 - Monday

	Met with Lacey at Keegan's for some lunch. Got two for one meals since it's my birthday week. The steak sandwich, for being $16, wasn't anything to write home about and we waited for our food for easily 40 min. So gray and wet outside and I just can't focus today. Blah.

	10/3

	Waking up clear headed without the regret of drinking the night before is a feeling I need to embrace. My 31st year will be a year of change.

	Gloomy, rainy, overcast.. gray. More blah.

	RETICENT. About sums me up.

	The twins are playing the Yankees tonight for the wild card; target field is playing the game on the Jumbotron so Lacey, David, and I might go check it out.

	10/4

	** Two days sober 

	"All we are is dust in the wind.."

	Client Wordpress training meeting today. Nervous as usual with any interaction. Need to just go in like I own the place.

	Like lacey said, just to remember you know more then them and they see you as the expert.

	10/5 - 
	Launched my first wordpress site at Rocket 55.. topgun-tech.com. 


	10/6 - 

	Bday gifts:


	Road tripping to Duluth to camp with Lacey, Ryan, and Anna. Just stopped in a random town Walmart, Forest Lake, to eat subway. Sometimes places like that just seem unreal.

	Joe rogan and Russel brand podcast.

	Set up camp in the dark and walked to the spirit mountain ski hill that overlooked Duluth and the bay.

	Ubered into town, struck out at a couple spots. Got a beer at both . . , and ended up at a cool little basement bar for a bar close cocktail. Got a cab back to the camp site, dude only took cash and was bitching about it like the bitch he was so we got a free ride. 

	10/7

	Haggard. Kidneys in rough shape. 
	Got brunch in Duluth at a little hip restaurant; Zeitgeist. Biscuits and gravy hit the spot. Popped into Duluth trading co to get some underwear and then we were off for two harbors. Day was overcast and chilly. Set up camp right off of the beach and pretty close to the water. Ryan and Anna went for a hike and Lacey and I tried our luck at some fishing in Superior.. we had none. After a few hours of sitting out on the point drinking beers, eating seeds, and not catching a damn thing we all walked downtown for some pizza at Do Nord Pizza and had a night cap beer at Castle Danger. On the walk home Ryan had to take an emergency shit in the trees..

	10/8

	Drove back to Duluth, checked out a nice little observation tower overlooking the water and the autumn colors. Best weather of the trip, sunny and 60s. We stopped at Bent Paddle following that before heading back to mpls. Quick stops at DQ and Hammerheart Brewery before we made it home. 

	31 years old today. 

	10/12

	“How can I love you if I don’t love myself. I love you.” - Dntl - Anyone Anywhere

	Working from spy house today. Cool breeze coming in the door. Struggling with my mental state and my addictions. I know it's not fair to Lacey that I'm so self conscious and struggle with constant anxiety, I wish I could be there for her more than I currently am.

	10/13

	Post work Volleyball at Champions Hall in Eden Prarie and Bowlero afterwards for Ashley's bday drink.

	10/14

	Whirlyball and Laser Tag for the tripod. Updown after and a house party at Soiseth's.

	“I didn't feel much different than I had always felt. I was neither elated nor dejected; it all seemed to just be a continuation.” - Ham on Rye - Bukowski

	10/19

	Pretty unproductive day at work full of dicking around on the internet trying to look productive.

	The last few days have been fast and furious with the quick turn around on the Maple Grove Hospital designs so feeling pretty lethargic.

	I need a vacation. And a raise.

	Volleyball tonight, early. David is coming over to play some rocket league and offered me a ride to MLK.

	Won 2 of 3 and got some food and drinks with the team at Herkimer after. Was such a nice night for late October.. mid 60's so we sat on the patio.

	10/20

	Flinto tutorials all morning. Getting lunch with the team (Bodhi's annual review) at Ray J's, looking forward to some wings. 

	Post work HH at Moose with Liz and Sumia. Friday night in with Lacey and the cats. Made a frozen pizza and watched the conjuring.

	10/21

	7:30am laying in the guest room with Huey and an ice pack, practically paralyzed with back/neck pain.

	My drink is having such a rough night - Lacey - spilled on me / blo dryer 

	Played some pinball at Morts and beat my high on Attack From Mars. Avery, Ryan, and Brett met up for a couple drinks before Lace


	10/22

	Lacey had to return some things so we bussed out the the Roseville mall. I've been on a hot sauce kick lately so we're going to BWW after and I'm getting their Blazin wings.

	Random free lunch at Crave for a soft opening. 

	BWW blazin, handled it like a champ.

	Lacey flew out to NY today for work. I worked from home and went to the chiropractor to try and fix my shitty back. 

	David came over to rocket league. Order some football pizza and drank a case of beer. 

	Soiseth stopped by later on, watched Nathan For You.

	10/24

	Considering seeing Cattle Decapitation again tonight at the caboose.. it's 22$. I definitely miss the days when shows were $5-10.

	I'm sure it'd be worth it.. When I saw them the dude spit a lougie on the floor and snorted it. All while dancing around in Christmas stocking decorations that he ripped off the wall of the Fargo VFW

	"NACHO NACHO MANNN, I wanna be a nacho Mann.” - Lacey

	Eggs Benedict round two.

	Lacey and I are headed to the YMCA to get memberships in attempt to get my fat ass into shape and assist in my two weeks of sobriety. Day 1.

	Had a successful workout for the first time in I don't know how long. Hoping this is a start to something new, something healthy.

	10/30 - M

	Unbearable anxiety today, to the point of almost shaking. Skipped free pizza at work to get out and chill at home for a little bit. My head is a pounding tangle of confused thoughts. Fear and doubt. I don't understand why.

	Called to see my psychiatrist but I haven't seen her for over a year so I'm not technically her patient anymore. She's on vacation until next week so it's just me and my thoughts until then.

	There's no way it's not noticeable; my aloofness/distance/apprehension. I just need a break.. I wish it was more socially acceptable to take mental health days without being labeled a slacker.

	Back to the gym today, hopefully it helps clear my mind.

	Sobriety day 2.

	10/31: Tuesday

	Sobriety day 3.

	Woke up with extreme anxiety this morning, dreading going in to work. It’s halloween today, I’m wearing a giant pizza slice. 

	Made some interactions today instead of completely avoiding them. Feeling a little lighter, more aware, less scared. My eyes are starting to open again.

	I want to remember my dreams, realize my goals, and accomplish them.

	Got off work and made some chicken chili and clean the house to procrastinate doing more work. From about 7pm-1pm worked on R55 shirt concepts; optionally but the winner gets $400 cash.

	One of the 5 concepts I designed I actually liked but I doubt it will get picked since it's a bit "out of the box".. we'll see. 

	Couldn't sleep until after 2 due to my high volume caffeine intake.

<h3>NOVEMBER 2017</h3>

	11/1

	Overcast and snowing.

	x4

	Out of it today due to lack of sleep.. well my normal sleep. I still got about 6 hours. It's 4:30 and I'm so out of it so I'm trying to find ways to pass this last half hour.

	Forcing myself to the Y after work. Lacey is in Montreal until Friday so need to occupy my time with not drinking. 

	Ryan joined the gym too so at least now I'll have someone to play basketball with.. 

	Brain fog, apathetic blank stares

	11/2 - Thurs
	x5

	Got to work today and found out to my surprise that I had a wordpress training session with a client, was super nervous but I got through it and it actually went really well.

	Felt a bit better today until I drank too much coffee.. the caffeine definitely spikes my anxiety. Going to switch to tea.

	Bussedh to volleyball.. lost all 3 by a close margin to the undefeated team in first place. Fairly sure we're in last place.

	Cleaned the house, made some chicken wings and doused them with a large array of hot sauces, and finished season 5 of Seinfeld. 

	Hangin' with the lazy boys.. Lacey's back tomorrow :)

	11/3 Fri
	x6

	Post work volleyball at Champions hall with Matt, Woody, and Amy. Super weird vibes from everyone there.. pick up games we're taking forever to start and there was little to no organization. Pretty meh overall.

	Came home to sleepy Lacey. She crashed early so I played video games.

	11/4
	x7

	Woke up early and jogged to the gym (worked out) and back. Then Lacey and I went on a grocery excursion, took the 10 up to Columbia Heights for an Aldi trip. Saw the weird Compton dolphins fan walking on central and some kid eating 3 lollipops at a time. Forgot a quarter but scored a cart anyways!

	Came home and we both made some soup.

	Was about to take a nap but heard about a big sale on jeans at Martin Patrick so I hopped back on a bus downtown, shipped a package and made my way over. Found a pair that I'd been wanting ($250 Rogue Territory Stantons) for $50. Ended up buying another pair of jeans too. 

	That store is amazing and I could easily get lost and spend my life's savings in there.

	Headed home to eat soup and watch Event Horizon with Lacey.

	11/5
	x8

	Woke up and ran to the gym again but was too sore to jog back. Lacey met me there.

	Made a giant omelet and relaxed for a bit and then decided to go to uptown to get some coffee and try to find the new Converge album at the Electric Fetus. They didn't have it but found somegood  used deals:

	- Mark McGuire
	- Beach House - Teen Dream
	- Dan Deacon - America
	- Animal Collective - 

	Soup and Curb Your Enthusiasm/Shark Tank night cap. Back to workkkkk.

	11/6 - Monday
	x9

	Mundane work day entering Wordpress content.

	Ran to the gym after work, met lacey, lifted, hottubbed, ran back.

	Made chicken wings which took forgoddamnever to dry out, Aldi must pump those fuckers full of water. Def not as good as Whole Foods. 

	11/7
	x10

	Got my swim goggles/flip flops in the mail yesterday, going to hit the gym after work and swim some laps. Listened to a podcast on the last days of Oliver Sacks and he used to swim a mile a day.. that's 33 laps; 66 times back and forth. Crazy. A good goal to strive for.. I'm sure I'll be dead after 5 laps.

	Already down 12lbs since joining the Y and abstaining from booze. 216 > 204.2. 

	Goal weight is 180 so still have a ways to go.

	11-8 - Wed 
	x11

	Anxiety has been back the last couple of days. I don't really have an explanation for it.. I've been getting good sleep, working out, not drinking.. I hate it. I scheduled an appt with Dr. Johnson but she doesn't have any openings until Jan. 2 so I'll have to wait it out.

	It's weird how some days I feel normal and others, like today, it's as though I have a dark cloud just weighing down on me. Brain fog. My vision seems to tunnel and I'm not as aware of my surroundings, I feel small, my eyes are shut to the world and I feel like retreating, isolating. Disorientation, self consciousness, lack of confidence. 

	A few days there I felt great, even happy. My eyes were open, I was quick, made an attempt to talk to coworkers and even strangers. 

	Taking off at noon today to get my passport and hopefully work out of the office for the rest of the day until my chiropractor appt. Maybe some time away will set me straight.

	You know the feeling when you stand up too fast and everything blurs? Or when you drive at night and everything closes in on you?

	Post work volleyball at Champions Hall. Got some lessons from a coach, learned that I was actually quite worse at vb than I thought.

	11/11 -Sat
	x14

	Morning workout. 5k, shot hoops, played racquetball, lifted, swam. So dead. Finally back under 200lbs; 198.2. 

	Took a nap and now planning on meeting up with some coworkers at Mortimers. 

	Headed to Morts a little early to play some pinball, Ryan and Anna joined. Broke my two weeks of sobriety and keto. Worth it? Probably not. There was a big group with little room to sit so we stood around and played foos and darts, I won both.

	Went home and dominated a frozen pizza.

	11/12 
	x1

	Hungover-ish. Tried to go to the triple rock for brunch before it closes with Ryan, Anna, and Michael but it was absurdly packed so we went to republic in 4 corners; it was actually really delishious. I got the fried chicken sandwich, lacey got eggs benny. After brunch Ryan, Brett, and I went to the Trylon to see the Jawbreaker documentary followed by a Q&A session afterwards with the producer. 

	Lacey and I started the sopranos and ordered Pagoda Chinese delivery.. we rated it 4/10. My beef and broccoli was practically unseasoned. Meh.

	11/13 - Mon

	I really fucking hate Mondays. At least I have binge watching Sopranos to look forward to.

	Not feeling the greatest - sore throat and a cough - so I decided to work from home. Got some stuff done but ultimately just feel guilty for being so lazy!

	11/15 - We'd
	☠️

	Feeling pretty crummy still but made it into work anyways. Teaaa, lots of teaaa.

	It always makes me so happy when Against Me - Sink, Florida, Sink plays when shuffling through a playlist. Makes me super nostalgic of my early college years and house parties at Chuck's old house in Moorhead.. everyone at the party would stop what they were doing to sing along.

	Flying Lotus 3D show tonight at First Ave.
	Went to to downtown Dulonos location before the show, definitely not the same. I miss living across the street from the OG uptown location.. heading over for 2-4-1s and playing pinball. 

	11/16

	Stayed home from work sick, feverish all day. Still ended up going to volleyball and surprisingly won all 3 despite me being all hopped up on DayQuil. Ubered home and ordered toppers.

	11/17 - Friday 
	x2

	Lacey and I are doing some research today on how to buy a car.. so adult of us. Hoping to go in tomorrow and pick up a Nissan Rogue. We're pretty set on this make and model, just hoping to negotiate a bit on price. Not the easiest task for two introverts.

	11/18 - Sat
	☠️

	Took an hour long bus ride down to the Luther Infiniti Dealership to test drive the Rogue. Showed up and the receptionist got me some coffee out of some weird futuristic kuerig that neither lacey nor I knew how to operate. We tried to brew lacey a cup but didn't know how to open it to insert a new coffee packet so we just left it.. we didn't want our first impression to but us scurrying around trying to clean up a coffee spill.

	Our saleman Aaron Olson came to get us and we drove to car for a bit.. we both knew this was the vehicle we wanted but we were trying to play it cool so we didn't give it away too much. Aaron was super chatty and kept distracting us and talking our ears off about his failed marriage while we were trying to drive. When we got back to he dealership we sat in his plain af office while he went over the car specs. Finally it came down to pricing and we voiced our concerns and asked to lower it to 19,900.. he went to check with his manager who apparently was displeased with the offer so he came in to negotiate. When all was said and done we got the price down an extra $500 which we accepted, pretty good for a couple of introverts. 

	We then had to figure out insurance and sign a shit load of paper work. When all was said and done we were there for 4 hours, but we left with a Nissan Rogue SL and are both super happy with it.

	We then tried to go to the mall of America but couldn't find parking so we just went to Taco Bell and called it a night!

	11/19 - Sun
	☠️

	Martin Patrick to pick up some jeans I had hemmed and got myself a haircut. A couple of cappuccinos to follow at Moose and Sadies.

	Lacey and I decided to get some brunch instead of hit the gym so we walked over to Spring Street to use a coupon we had.

	Vikings fans for as far as they eye could see, we couldn't have been more out of place. 

	Deep cleaned the house and made some pasta. 

	11/20 - Mon

	Converge - A Single Tear

	Bored at work with nothing to do, seriously feel underutilized most days. Jogged to the gym and played some racquetball with ryan and we got in on some pick up whirlyball which was a lot of fun.

	11/21 - Tues
	x2

	Podcast - 20 Thousand Hertz

	Bored again so just listening to podcasts and dicking around on the internet. Oneee more day before a nice and needed 4 day weekend in Storm Lake with the Nehrings for thanksgiving.

	Gym jog, quick swim and home for some Tony Time. 

	11/22 - Wed 
	☠️

	"Even if god is dead you're still gunna kiss his ass.." - Tony Soprano

	Famous Daves BBQ catered for lunch today at r55. I ate at my desk because I'm too awkward, anxious, and antisocial to eat with everyone else.

	Post work happy hour at Moose with Lacey Ryan and Anna for a couple Johnny Jump Ups. 

	11/23 Thurs 
	☠️

	First time hitting 200k in blockfolio.

	Thanksgiving day. 60+ degrees and a few podcasts made for a nice drive to Storm Lake.

	Called home and mom and dad were just at home cooking a thanksgiving meal of their own and it sounds like katie and Anton did the same. A little strange not seeing everyone for the holiday, it might be one of the first I haven't seen them. We'll be back in Watertown for xmas.

	We got in and soon headed into town to visit Lacey's grandma and Aunt Pam for a few hours. We sat around while they ate their thanksgiving dinner. Darlene was looking so much better after her fall, she should have her brace off by the new year.  

	Came home to crockpot hot beefs. 

	11/24 - Fri
	☠️

	Jim Carrey / Kaufman doc.

	"A divine glow. A spark that slowly dies out"
	 
	Sat around for most of the day and watched tv/movies. Helped Lacey's mom make some salads and we had a ham dinner, followed by a fried food fest later on. Egg rolls, curds, pickles, "potsuckers".

	11/25 - Sat
	☠️

	Drive into town and ate some BBQ for lunch at the smoking Hereford, easily my favorite restaurant I've been to in Storm Lake. I had a giant "silo" sized beer (64oz) and a sandwich with brisket, bacon, and chicken. Pretty delicious. We then went to Pinks? to play some pool with Lacey's parents.. we got beat!

	11/26
	☠️

	Met Mark and Lori in Fort Dodge for lunch at Tom Thumbs before heading back to Minneapolis.

	11/27
	x1

	Bored as fuck at work with nothing to do. Post work gym and walleyball with Ryan and Lacey.

	Talked to David about finding some freelance work together.. he'd take care of sales and client relations and I'd design and develop. I feel like I'd be so much happier doing something on my own.

	11/28
	x2

	Moving desks today at work, I now get a sit/stand. Hopefully the new seating arrangement with ease some of my anxiety.. I don't do well in this open floor plan.

	This still doesn't solve my workload problem, or lack there of.

	Cutting back on drinking makes me very aware of why I've always drank to begin with. I feel like I'be been living with depression so long that I just take it as normal. Everything is just so suppressed and devoid of meaning. I'm not particularly sad, but I'm far, far from happy. Every day is just a continuation. Things happen, and they end but the in between is mostly lost on me. My memory is shit and my brain fog is awful. It makes interacting with people increasingly difficult. This is why I isolate. Incapable of experiencing joy. I show little or no emotion most of the time..  tunnel vision. Fragmented thoughts.

	Bitcoin surpassed 10k today, hopefully ETH will make a run soon.. looking for $500 by EOY

	Depression worsening. Asked my boss(es) if I could work from home today and they asked what my reasoning was; I told them about my anxiety and how I don't thrive in that office environment.. it makes me feel so weak. It almost gives me more anxiety than to begin with. Fuck I hate this. I seriously just want to die sometimes. I'm just so sad. I need help.
	Called in: Doctor appt Tues Dec 5 @ 1:00

	Got coffee at Analace, got some groceries, and worked at home. Crazy how much better I feel when I'm not around so many people. 

	Had volleyball tonight but was not feeling it. We won 2 of 3.

<h3>DECEMBER 2017</h3>

	12/1 - Friday
	x5

	SSDD. Brainfog and don't give a fuck about my job. Ashley sent me over some Allan Watts videos, maybe some motivation will help my cause.

	Went to Kim's on Central with Lacey to get some pho for lunch.

	Grizzly Bear @ The Palace Theater. By far the best venue in Mpls/St Paul. Grizzly Bear was kind of disappointing.. Lacey and I aren't really into their new album so it left a lot to be desired. The Veckatamist material they played was awesome though. 

	12/2
	x6

	Gym and a few errands. David came by for a bit to drop off some green. Stayed in and watched sopranos.

	12/3
	x7

	Gym and a lazy Sunday. Meal prepped some lunches and made some turkey soup with leftovers from thanksgiving. Lacey's childhood cat Shaq died today.

	12/4
	x8

	Ran to the gym but was too tired to lift, let alone run home. I think I have starting Keto to blame.

	12/5 - Tues
	x9

	First snowfall of the year. 
	Had to be in at 7 this morning to help launch Rollx Vans, finallyyyy it’s done after working on it for like 7 months. 

	￼

	Meeting with my psychiatrist today, looking for some suggestions. I feel less panicky the past few days but it comes and goes. Also hoping that the cutting back on drinking and watching what I’ve been eating lowered my blood pressure.. if not I think I should probably figure something out there.

	I met with Dr. Johnson and she prescribed me zoloft for my anxiety and a mood stabilizer. It takes up to two weeks (*FRODO ITS OVER)

	12/6
	x10

	Sitting in the bathroom after a team meeting to relax after having a mini panic attack. Day two on zoloft and the panic is still very real and pretty severe. I was fine earlier this morning but it hit me hard sitting in that conference room, even though it wasn't it felt like an interrogation. I could feel my heart pounding and my hands shaking as it went around the room waiting for my response to various aspects of our process. My responses were brief and I feel like everyone can sense my anxiety. It's embarrassing as hell. I seriously may need to quit if this continues, I should be able to comfortably talk to colleagues. 

	12/7
	x11

	Woke up at 7am and couldn't get back to sleep due to negative thoughts and a mild headache. Dreading going in to work again is making me panicky.
	Day 3 of Zoloft, so far mild headaches, increased heartbeat, and brain fog.

	Emailed my boss(es) and Hannah who is supposed to be our HR department  and told them about my doctors appt/new medication so I’m working from home today, tomorrow, and maybe a number of days over the next couple weeks while I try to get used to this new medication and for fucks sake hopefully not get manic again. Just the thought of that makes me anxious.. I’d almost definitely have to quit my job and it would set me back once again.

	Our indoor volleyball tournament starts tonight. Matt is out but Amy’s brother Jeff is going to sub.

	3:45 - Feeling a little more relaxed than this morning. Seeming to find words more easily and not as nervous.

	6:00 - Back to anxiety. Noticed my face and ears getting really warm and my heart rate racing again. Won our volleyball game and advanced to the second round of the tournament! 

	Petrichor - The smell of rain

	12/8
	x12

	Wfh today and so happy about it. Woke up early, cleaned the kitchen, made some bulletproof coffee, and some bacon. Working on a site for Haagen Dazs today so naturally I'll be thinking about ice cream all day.

	12:15pm - Took my pill a little earlier today but the panic is coming in waves. Nervous/shaky. Already dreading going back to work. Negative thoughts about myself and ability to communicate or express myself. Feeling scared of hypothetical situations. So dumb. Not a huge appetite but going to eat to see if it helps. Kicking caffeine after today.

	12/9 - Sat
	x13

	Headed to the gym and played some 21 with Ryan and Brett. Just like in middle school playing in their driveway, aside from the presence of shirtless Dale. 

	Bowled at Elsie’s in the afternoon with Lacey, Ryan, Brett, and Korman. I bowled awfully but Lacey did decent, 130’s.

	Quiet night at home.

	"We only have what we remember"

	Dreaded going in to work today but had a couple of coherent conversations without stressing out too much. Felt a little more calm, still not normal but better than last week. Skipped the gym today, going to make some dinner and watch some cops (our recent guilty pleasure). 

	Took a seroquel and it knocked me tf out!

	12/12 - Tuesday
	x16

	Album: Mount Eerie - A Crow Looked At Me (so sad but so beautiful)

	Feeling pretty out of it this morning, probably should cut that seroquel in half. Really groggy, feels like a post nap state.

	$352k in blockfolio, I made $61,200 today. That is $1,200 more than my full year’s salary. 🙏 

	Post work basketball with Ryan and Clarkson, we played terribly and got beat by a bunch of Somali kids.

	Popped half of a seroquel, wish me luck.

	12/13
	x17

	Not as groggy today, feeling much better. Working from home because I can. Already got some chores done this morning, put on our license plates and drove Lacey to the bus stop, cleaned up the house, threw a pork shoulder in the crock pot, and moved in our patio furniture/bikes for the winter.

	Cats are chillin’ hard af by the radiator today.

	Another huge day already for crypto.. ETH blew past 700, testing 800.

	Drank too much coffee.. caffeine definitely makes my anxiety worse.

	12/14 - Thurs
	x18

	Finally we have flex hours at r55. Pretty much means we can work anywhere any time as long as we put in 8 hours, I’m so happy about this. 

	Second week of the tournament for our fall season of volleyball tonight. You to have to miss the r55 xmas Party unfortunately.

	We (Beerme Sanders) won our first and lost in the championship to an undefeated team (Droppin’ Plates). Second place, not too bad considering we were 5th out of 8 in the regular season.

	12/15 - Friday

	Late start today, got in at 11. Don’t have anything to work on really so I’m booking some trips. Ski trip in March and an impromptu trip to Denver in May to see Tycho/Phantogram at Red Rocks. Next up, Mexico!

	Received a thermal Rick Astley mug from my secret Santa and a nice zip up r55 fleece from Steven.

	Post work happy hour with Lacey, Angelina, Sumia, and Liz. JL Beers to follow with Lacey, goodbye Keto. I ate my weight in chips.

	12/16 - Sat

	Mark and Lori were supposed to come and get the Malibu today but Mark was sick so Lacey and I planned our Mexico trip, booked our flights, and reserved our rooms at the Hyatt Ziva all inclusive resort. In spirit of going to Mexico we headed to eat street and got some chips and queso and a margarita at Pancho Villa; it smelled like fish and soap and they were playing terrible Spanish xmas music.

	Quick stop at tilt for some pinball and then to the Asian market. 

	Most likely our last visit ever to treehouse records before it closes at the end of the month. 

	Night in with the cats, ramen, and Tony Soprano.

	12/17 
	Organized my crypto and got Lacey set up with her Ledger Nano. Moved around about 400k between exchanges and wallets.. stressful. Can’t wait for tax season :/

	12/18 - Mon

	WFH and a doctor’s appt. Medication dosage increase. My depression is lifting but am still pretty anxious.

	Gym and home.

	12/20 - Wed
	x3

	WFH again. Spent a few hours at spyhouse and jogged to the gym to meet lacey. 

	🍣 Sushi for dinner.

	12/21 - Thurs

	Back in the office. Chipotle for lunch with Bodhi and Liz. Can’t wait for break. 

	Got a nice card from Evan and Nelson; lucky they’re supportive of my shitty brain or I’d probably be without a job right now.

	12/22 - Friday

	Half day at work. Lacey and I (+ Huey) decided to head back to Watertown a day early. Got back around 5 and ordered Godfather’s Pizza.

	12/23 - Sat

	Mom, Lacey, and I ran a few errands during the day. Got the car washed, Dakota butcher for some tiger meat, target for a few last minute gifts, and AT&T to get the iPhone X. 

	Katie called in “sick” to work at Costco so her and Anton could come a day early. 

	Fajitas and margaritas.

	We sat around, had some drinks, and played some games; exploding kittens and the meme game. Anton wanted to go downtown so him, Lacey, and I went to docs to play some pool. 

	Anton was lit up on Budweiser’s and we woke up most of the house talking too loud in the kitchen about his DUI and distrust in authority.

	12/24

	Pretty hungover, slept until close to noon. Anton was worse off.

	We all opened presents (we got a food saver, an infusing pitcher, a goos family cookbook, a Qdoba gift card, and a few other little things).

	Had a ham dinner and then Anton had to head back to Omaha. The rest of us sat around and watched Forensic Files. 

	12/25 - Mon
	Met Grandma, Laurie, and Jessica out at Dakota Sioux where they were having a xmas day dinner. Played some slots and lost $30 in a matter of minutes. Grandma was winning of course. 

	She’s looking pretty fragile these days.. she’s starting chemo in a couple of weeks to target an early stage cancer. 

	I wish I knew her better.

	12/26 - Tues

	Another day filled with naps. It’s impossible to stay awake in the living room by the fireplace. It’s Huey’s favorite spot to curl up too. Finished season 5 of Sopranos.. one more to go.

	Mom drove us out to the prop for beers and burgers but they weren’t serving food so we went to Foxys instead; met up with Katie, Caitlin, David, and Bob Vansickle.

	Mom and Dad headed home and we all went to play Foosball at Sparkys and Docs. Learned that David might be buying Mahowald’s Hardware and potentially his parents house. Looks like he might never leave Watertown..

	Queso after party in the kitchen.

	12/27
	Home from vacation finally, even though it flew by as it always does. I hate leaving home, it always makes me sad. 

	Got home, cleaned up the house a bit, and ordered pho from Pho 79.

	12/28 - Thurs

	Day off with Lacey. Had a few mimosas, watched Sopranos and took a nice long nap. 

	12/29 - Friday

	Back to work for one day this week. Anxiety is back, might be from drinking practically every day this past week. Might also not help that I just started seroquel again last night and my brain just feels fried. Seeing Barb again next week.

	10/30 - Sat

	El Nuevo Mariachi for a couple tacos and margs. It was dead and the constant beeping of the door was driving us crazy but the food was good. Last time we went the salsa was so hot that we had to ask for milder, I was personally hoping it was that hot again but they must have tamed it down. It was a delicious homemade hanebero salsa though so I can’t complain. 

	Tilt for some pinball after, played champions pub pretty much the whole time. Couldn’t decide what we wanted for dinner so we ended up just going to cub to load up on some groceries. 

	10/31 - Sun

	Took care of bills practically all morning.

	Bussed to uptown in the early afternoon. We didn’t feel very social so we decided to  have a few drinks and head home early while avoiding the nye crowd.

	Morts pinball / Red Dragon wondrous punch and wontons / Liquor Lyles buck hunter / red savoy Philly cheesesteaks and Home by 10. Pretty great NYE with Lacey.  

	She fell asleep early so I rang in the new year playing rocket league with David.

	Blockfolio - 530k

	Anxiety was awful this morning, I’m nearing a point where if it continues I might have to quit and do something else. Was fantasizing about working in a bookstore today, something calm. 

	I’ve been drinking again, a lot. Need to cut it out before I dig myself a hole. The problem is that it makes me feel normalcy for a while when my brain isn’t so anxious. I actually feel happy sometimes. But then again I’m sober, semi hungover, in the morning before going to work, looking at myself in the mirror fucking scared of the world and shaking because I’m so anxious. Funny how things work.

	Lacey and I met up with Eli at Williams after work to play some pool. Haven’t seen him since he moved to Boulder.. he seems to like the work but hate the city. Too much of a college town so he’s looking to move to Denver. His dart game was on point.

	1/3

	Fucking anxiety again today, I think it’s mostly due to this one weekly meeting that we do where we have to go around the room and talk about our week.. idk why it’s so hard for me. I’m meeting a client and art directing a project and that even seems easier for some reason.

	Taking the afternoon to work from home and (try to) get my head right. Getting back to the gym and trying to kick the booze again.

	WFH today, except not much work being done. I think the seroquel is just putting me in a daze.. I’ve been sleeping incredibly hard (Lacey says I’ve been snoring) and when I wake up I’m so out of it. Having trouble concentrating and overall just getting motivated to do anything.

	Saw Barb this morning. She discontinued the Seroquel and prescribed Abilify instead; it’s apparently less sedating. Literaly felt like I was a walking cloud today.

	Lunch date at Punch Pizza with Lacey, sometime’s I miss working there; the smell, the warmth, the music (despite the receptiveness).   

	Drove to Caffetto to try and get some work done but their internet was shit so I played a few games of pinball and headed home. 

	Tofu stir fry and Black Mirror.

	1/5 - Friday

	Pretty tired this morning.. Didn’t get much sleep last night, it was either the coffee or the Abilify (it’s known to cause insomnia). Going to give it another shot tonight. Lacey’s flight to Shanghai got cancelled for tomorrow so she doesn’t fly out until Sunday now.

	1/6

	Lacey left at 3am to get to the airport.. first stop San Fran and then off to Shanghai. 

	I was planning on increasing my dosage today to 200mg Zoloft, luckily I read my appt recap.. found out that I was already increased from 50mg to 100mg. The higher dosage pills were confusing.

	Feeing a bit jittery this morning, similar to multiple cups of coffee. Thoughts racing slightly. I slept alright last night though so that’s a plus.

	Went to a metal show with Ryan, Brett, and Korman. Thou and False at the Entry. Both were really great. The crow was weak so Ryan and I started a pit.

	Korman and I stayed out for a bit and accidentally walked into a gay strip club, the brass rail.

	1/7

	Very hungover. Stayed in bed until noon and then ordered a stuffed crust pizza.. I ate it all. 

	1/8

	Mediocre work day, slightly less anxious.
	David came to town for our first broomball game today.. It was ideal conditions, temps in the 30’s. We won 6-0 and I had a hat trick. Hat trick Swayze 1-0.

	Post game darts and team beers at Moose, I won both games. 

	Rocket League and pizza to end the night.

	Went to the Y and played some basketball with Ryan, Bodhi, and Ike (Liz’s bf). 

	1/10

	WFH in the morning, cleaned the house. Went in in the afternoon for my meetings which actually went decently. The anxiety was there but it felt more controlled. 

	Ran to the gym, lifted, and ran home. I’m severely out of shape after the holidays. Need to cut again before Mexico.

	1/11

	Missed my dose of Abilify for the 3rd night. I feel fine but had a dream that David told me to watch myself.

	Attended a UX event in Bloomington at “tech systems” with a few coworkers. We got some grub and a couple beers before at Poor Richards. The speaker was alright but we all kind of felt that the subject matter wasn’t super relevant to us.

	1/12

	Post work Moose happy hour with the r55 team. Had a couple people over for a few drinks and hangs before bowling at Elsie’s.  Korman, Ryan, Angelina, Liz, Bodhi.


	Watched YouTube videos and listened to music with Ryan and Korman. There was an overarching theme of time:

	Pearl Jam - Evolution
	Album Leaf - Always For You
	Explosions In The Sky - 

	4:30am. Eating ramen noodles. Ryan passed out at my place.

	4:45  

	1/13

	Slightly manic, I think. Talkative, distracted.. could be the caffeine. 

	Ryan and I met up with Korman and his roommate at Spring St for some hangover grub and some hair of the dog. Ryan “Barf Simpsoned”. I’m full as heck.

	Lacey is home tonight. I talked to Ryan last night about proposing in Mexico. Time will tell.

	1/14

	Watching: Shameless

	Lacey slept for a good chunk of the morning, she’s pretty jet lagged. She brought me back a bunch of candy, a notebook, and a nice card.

	She talked me into brunch at Red Cow (her favorite is the chilaquilles). I got the fish and chips.

	Took a nap during the Vikings game, they actually won a playoff game for a change. 

	1/15 - Monday

	Tough to get to work today. Pretty boring day.. just waiting for Moose HH and broomball. Ryan turns 31 today.

	Won our game, 1-0 and had a few drinks with the team afterwards.

	1/16 - Tues

	WFH. Cleaned the house and did some laundry.

	Skipped my psychiatrist appt to take a nap with Hueboy. Slipping again, felt like drinking so I made a trip to Surdyks. 

	Volleyball starts tonight at 7:15. We won 2-1. Found out that Matt’s cat and Huey’s old roommate, Sushi (Su Su) died from an asthma attack.

	R55 smells like straight polyurethane today from some building repairs, getting a little light headed.

	Bought Lacey an engagement ring last night. Hoping it will be here by the 26th. 8 more days before Mexico! 🇲🇽 

	1/18 - Thurs

	WFH to avoid huffing the office air. I love waking up and making coffee with the chemex, it’s ritualistic and therapuetic.

	Played rocket league with David for a few hours. Lacey and I got a couple drinks and some food at Dulonos (I miss the original!) and then went and saw Destroyer at Fine Line, they were great as usual. The guitarist was drinking heavily, probably 10 drinks in the hour (not exaggerating). Lacey got in for free AND she got a set list, she was so happy :)

	1/19 - Friday 

	40’s and sunny 😎 

	Spent the night in playing ps4. Made Lacey and I some breaded chicken/rice and finally fixed our dumb broken cabinet door.

	1/20 - Sat

	Played a little pinball at Tilt but there was a state tournament going on so it was pretty busy. Made a quick stop at the asian market for some Samyang 2x Spicy ramen and then got my hair cut at Floyds (Damon).. I think I’ve had him before but he does a good job!

	Sitting at Libertine having a beer after my haircut. Not a bad bar, a bit bro but two totally unused ping pong tables and a few pins. 

	Decided to get dinner at Nighthawks, our service was awful but the food was delicious per usual. We got 50% off our tab and a free round of drinks.

	Lacey and I finally purchased a humidifier (no more bloody noses) and got the car washed as we listened to Kings of Convenience. Exciting Saturday night! #gettingray

	1/21 - Sun

	Spring street brunch, onion rings and a breakfast sandwich. I took a nap and Lacey cleaned the house. Matt came over for the Vikings ACF championship game against the Eagles, the game was terrible. The Vikings got demolished but we made some decent homemade pizzas and had a few beers. 

	I gave Matt one of our old xbox 360’s with some games, should keep him busy!

	1/22 - Mon

	Worked a half day and headed home to wfh due to the weather. We got 17” of snow. Started doing laundry and getting things together for Mexico.

	1/23 - Tues

	WFH again today, our car was almost completely buried. Drove to the liquor store to find out I’d forgotten my wallet, I took it as a sign and came home and drank anyways. Why do I do this, I know it’s pathetic. February is a new start.. 

	Simulation theory and how we’re an experiment of how substances will interact with objects algorithmically at a randomized patterns. Just a thought.

	Volleyball tonight, we lost 2 of 3. All were close games.

	Randomly watched Black Mirror - Hang The Dj after having thoughts on simulation theory, which was also about simulation theory and about match making. 99.8% - Lacey and I were about a 99% match on okcupid. 

	1/24

	3:15am - Been up since midnight. Abilify has been causing some insomnia.

	Bought some booze and drank privately. Every day I feel more destructive.

	Lacey had a bad day at work so we went to Ginger Hop for some apps and a drink. Got the carmelized onion cream cheese wontons and they were bombbbb.

	Got matt a 6pack for checking in on the cats while we’re in Mexico.

	Made a pizza and crashed hard on some seroquel.

	1/25

	Crazy to think we’ll be in Puerto Vallarta in less than a day! The ring came in the mail yesterday, it’s a minimal 14k gold ring with a small diamond. I think she’ll really like it, she’s not really one to be flashy. Still unsure how I want to propose..

	1/26

	Woke up at 3am to head to the airport, Lacey and I felt a bit sick to our stomachs. Currently sitting in the Timberland lounge, drinking a couple bloody Mary’s and having some very lackluster eggs bennys.

	Made it to Puerto Vallarta, the airport was crazy but we managed to get a taxi to the Hotel Tropicana. The hotel is beautiful, nice pools, private beach, and in a great location. Had to get some cash so we walked around until we found an ATM, grabbed some booze and snacks, and made our way back to get to the beach (after a few tequila shots). 

	We sat on the beach for a while, constantly getting barraged by local vendors, but watched the Pacific Ocean for the first time (and tried swimming but it was too cold).

	Post beach we got a quick chips/salsa/queso app at Tacos Revolucion (not good), made our way into a couple shops and browsed the market (good), and stood in line for some (really good) local tacos at Pancho’s Taco’s. 

	We had to pee so came back quick and then checked out the pier before watching some Spanish Simpsons and calling it a night.

	Puerto Vallarta is really beautiful.

	1/27 - Sat

	Woke up early to the waves crashing hard on the beach. Played around with the camera a bit and watched to sun rise. 7:30am and people are already rushing to get a good spot at the pool/on the beach.

	LACEY’S ACCOUNT 
	——————————

	Jan 27
	This was a crazy one. We woke up at the Hotel Tropicana in Puerto Vallarta.we intended to catch a “city tour” that we grabbed a brochure of when we checked in, but it was already 9:13 and the tour started at 9. We decided to book the tour for the following day and went to get breakfast. With our rooms, breakfast was included so we went to check out the spread. Jon got some pretty bomb chilaquiles and I got some “hot cakes” with a weird, artificial maple syrup. 
	Noemi, the super nice lady at the Tropicana, told us there was a market going on at the square near by so after breakfast we walked the few blocks there. The market was very busy and full of great things. We tried some delicious salsas, olive tapenade, hummus, and oh god, the freshest Oaxaca cheese that I will be dreaming about for years. We bought some coconut milk and worried about getting sick from the ice, some delicious, nutty, baklava, and then I got an ice cream cone- avocado ice cream and a lime sorbetto. So good! After the market, we walked up the Malécon to explore. We saw mariachi bands, Street performers ( like a guy covered in sand, with a sand table, chess set and all), and lots of tacky souvenirs. Our end goal was to get to Pepe’s tacos, but we were not in a hurry. Pepe’s didn’t open until 1:00, so we popped into a place kitty corner called La Tradicionale. We got a shot of tequila each, a modelo for jon, and I wanted to order a whiskey coke, but ended up just getting the whiskey. They also brought us some cucumbers sprinkled with some chili powder seasoning and lime. Not too bad. Then we made our way to pepe’s where we ordered a few al pastor tacos, beef tacos, and some guacamole. Overall it was pretty good, but decided they were not the best tacos we had ever had. 
	After Pepe’s we walked back in the Malécon on the way home. We saw our first stray dog on the beach and also noticed a stand on the beach selling oysters. Jon bought a plate of six and they disappeared quickly. 
	We got back to the hotel and decided to hit the pool. We found some chairs in the sun and after a while decided to hop into the pool, which was not heated. Jon taught me a new swimming stroke and then we ordered margaritas from the cabana boy. We decided maybe we had enough sun and headed back to the room to get ready for dinner. 
	For dinner, we planned on going to Barcelona Tapas, a restaurant up the mountain with a good view of the city. We didn’t have our phones, so we had to get creative on finding our way there. We got a ways up the Malécon and then had to ask a tour guide salesman for directions. He was slightly helpful, but once we found our way to the restaurant, we found that we had made reservations at the wrong Barcelona Tapas and that they were full for the night. We were a little bummed, but decided it wasn’t meant to be. Instead we went to Senor Frogs, a super Americanized place Jon’s parents stopped at when they were in Puerto Vallarta years ago, for a drink. It was awful and loud, but I’m glad we went. We decided to walk back to the hotel to get Jon’s phone, but stopped to get onion rings (a weird craving I have been having and a food I recently decided I loved?!) and chicken stripes at a nearby restaurant. 
	We got the food to go and on the few blocks back to the hotel, a guy offered to sell us pipes and then weed. I was so used to saying “no gracias” all day, I said no and we kept walking on. After realizing what we said no to, we turned back and ordered 200 pesos of weed and also a gram of coke for 500. He had to go get more, so after an anxious 30 minutes we met him back on the street for the exchange. Then we decided to get another 500 of coke from our new friend Tony, the nicest stranger drug dealer we may ever meet. 
	It had been a long day, but we decided to break into one of the grams to test it out and then took a walk to go to the nearby pier on the beach. The pier leads to a weird metal structure that is lit up by all sorts of lights and we just sat on the pier, talking and playing with our new Sony 600 camera. 
	The pier overlooked a lot of nice looking restaurants that had tables on the beach, so we decided that was our next stop. We walked on the beach to the busiest restaurant we saw and got a candlelit table right on the ocean. It was perfect. I ordered a gin cocktail with cardamom, flowers, and berries and jon a whiskey cocktail that had red pepper on it, but it was delicious. Weirdly enough, we were talking about rings (I had been searching for the perfect turquoise or opal souvenir with little luck) and started talking about wedding rings. A mariachi band started playing at a table near by, and after telling jon I hadn’t thought much about what I would like for a wedding ring, he reached into his bag and pulled out a ring box and said “hopefully it will be something like this” and asked me to marry him with the most perfect ring. I of course cried. 
	A few minutes later, the mariachi band stopped at our table and played us a “romantic” song. We wish we would have got the name, but missed our chance. The whole setting was absolutely perfect and I am still in disbelief. The whole thing was perfectly private and exciting... very us. 
	After leaving the beach, we decided one more stop was in the cards and walked to a bar that was busy every time we walked by and ordered our first tequila shots as an engaged couple before calling it a night. 

	💕

	1/28

	Puerto Vallarta City tour with our guide Gustavo. What was supposed to be 4 hours turned into. 6.5 hour tour.

	Brief (very) history of Vallarta. They took us to the Malecon and the Cathedral, both of which we saw the day before. Then they took us to an opal mine/jewelry store where we found Lacey a nice raw opal ring. 

	“Little boobies. Operation more bigger.”

	Tequila tasting with the roosters crowing in the distance.

	Lunch at the OK Corral, I had lobster, a red snapper, jumbo shrimp, and mahi mahi paired with a ridiculous drink in a coconut called the Coco Loco. 10/10

	Finally made it back and walked to the jewelry store to pick up Lacey’s ring before we checked out and grabbed a cab to the Ziva.

	We walked around the resort to get our bearings, got plenty of drinks, a buffet, and called it a night.. Or tried to, I was up vomiting my guts out all night.

	1/29 

	Food poisoning ruined this day. I was in bed with cold sweats and rumblies for a majority of it. Sat on the beach for maybe an hour and got a tiny bit of food before returning to the room to sleep. Lacey sat out and read and got a chilequelles dinner.

	1/30

	Buffet
	Volleyball
	Pool

	1/31 - Wed

	Morning spa day. We got a couples massage and hung out around the private pool. “Es tu comfortable señor Jon?” 

	Blaze for lunch with our lunch date lizard. Calamari and some quesadillas. Oaxaca cheese and steak. 

	We explored a crazy rock with all sorts of crustaceans.

	Some midday coke and a dip in the infinity hottub. Tried to play some volleyball again but everyone was so incredibly bad that it wasn’t even fun.

	Facetimed with the parents and told them about the engagement today. While on the phone with Mom/Dad the “romance conceirge” sent us a bottle of champagne and some chocolate covered strawberries (totally unplanned) and a card that said “Happy Engagement!”. This was a perfect way to surprise them.

	Asian restaurant for dinner. Chicken pad Thai and some mediocre sushi.

<h3>FEBRUARY 2018</h3>

	2/1 - Thurs

	Woke up to the sunrise and juice box mimosas before taking our last dip in the (warm)tub.

	Used the priority pass at the lounge in PV and again in Denver. Had a decent burger, pretty happy to have some American food again.

	Full day of traveling, finally made it back to a snowy, zero degree, Minneapolis around 10:30pm.

	2/2 - Friday

	“WFH”. Still recuperating from the trip. Lacey is coming down with something, not feeling too hot. 

	Made homemade pho (the best one yet!). 

	Rocket League with David until 3am, FUCKING LAG OMG.

	2/3 - Sat

	Pretty lazy day, Lacey’s still not feeling great so we mostly stuck around the house. I ran a few errands and did some chores.

	Dad bought a new ice shack so I found a Vexilar depth finder on craigslist as a early bday present/shack warming present for him.

	2/4 - Sun
	Mogwai- Burn Girl Prom Queen

	Woke up early and played some Uncharted. Organizing photos from PV and already wish I was back.

	Started drinking at 7am. I need help but not sure where to begin.

	Wedding songs: 
	Explosions - Your Hand In Mine
	Album Leaf - Always For You

	Watched the super bowl with Lacey. We didn’t really have much interest but the game was actually pretty decent, Eagles won.

	2/5

	Back to reality.. broomball tonight at 9. David’s coming to town to play so we’ll probably hang out a bit before.

	Moose tacos and some scotch before the game. We won 1-0, I scored our goal.

	McDonald’s post game.

	2/6 - Tues

	Homemade pizzas with the fiancée.

	“That is just a lot of ranch, it was just so fun. It’s fun to squirt ranch.”

	2/7 - Wed

	Told the r55 team about our engagement today. Post work binge drinking by myself until I passed out. Sad times. Hoping next week I’ll feel more motivated to pull back.

	2/8 - Thurs

	Woke up at 5 and started working early. Didn’t have much to do so played RL with David for a majority of the day.

	More homemade pizza and Shameless. BBQ chicken and a chicken/bacon/ranch.

	2/9 - Fri

	Heading back to Watertown tonight, planning on doin some ice fishing with Dad tomorrow.

	Ate 3 ghost peppers last night and holy shit my stomach is wrecked today.

	Got back to Watertown around 9:30. We swung by Culver’s for some butter burgers  before arriving at home. Shot the shit a little and went to bed pretty early since we were going to get up somewhat early for fishing.

	2/10 - Sat

	I woke up early and worked on my portfolio. Once everyone else was up we loaded up the vehicles and drove out to Dry Lake; by Florence. It was negative wind chill so the initial set up of the shack was pretty damn cold but we got all settled in and realized that we had forgotten chairs and the vexilar so lacey and I drove back to Watertown to grab some supplies.

	We ended up getting Casey’s pizza for lunch, grabbed the supplies, and drove back out there (David followed).

	No bites all day but had some good conversation, some beverages, and snacks. David left around 6:30 and not long after I moved the vexilar to a different hole and almost immediately got a bite. 16” walleye. 

	When we got home I cleaned the fish with dad’s help and we ate leftover pizza.

	I ate my first whole dried ghost pepper and didn’t die.

	2/11

	Mom, Dad, Lacey, and I visited grandma goos at the nursing home today. She’s been there for about a week after her simultaneous fall, mild heart attack, and pneumonia. She looked very fragile but she had her wits and humor about her as usual. 

	We had some roast beef and potatoes for lunch and she told us a story about her three dogs on the farm, all of which tragically died. One was shot by a neighbor, another accidentally poisoned, and the last hit by a car. She teared up telling us about it, I could really tell she missed them.

	She’s not happy to be there but she’s a good sport about it.. I think the thought of being able to go back home is keeping her motivated to get better.

	2/12 - Mon x1

	David came over for broomball. He scored the only goal of the game. We won 1-0. Only one game left this season.

	2/13 - Tues x2

	Went to rocket in the morning for a meeting, I finally have a new dev project to work on. Not the most exciting (cherrywood) but it’s something.

	WFH in the afternoon to sign for Lacey’s resized ring, it fits and she loves it!

	Won all three of our volleyball games, we all played really well. Lacey and I “treated” ourselves to White Castle/McDonalds after. We’re disgusting I know.

	2/14 - Wed

	Valentine’s day.

	KOK - “The sun sets on the wharf and everything is new”

	Listening to kings of convenience and remembering a very sunny morning at my Garfield house where lacey and I put together a puzzle with a couple cups of coffee in hand. There was one piece missing,

	“I want a puzzle with pieces missing” - sing softly to me

	“Love comes like surprise ice on the water, love comes at dawn”

	2/15

	Typical work day. Got off and drank whiskey secretively. It needs to stop.

	2/16

	I woke up thinking it was Thursday because I’m a piece of shit and drank enough to forget.

	Happy hour with Lacey at Moose.

	“Goddamn I got lemon juice in my hangnail” - L

	Made sloppy joes with Lacey and watched Borg vs McEnroe.

	2/17

	Decided to get some lunch at Ramen Kazama.

	“Oooo I’m excited to slurppp it” - L about Ramen Kazama

	I got a spicy sausage curry miso ramen and it was delicious, L got the classic Tonkatsu. I give it an 8.5/10.

	Afterwards we tried to play pinball at Tilt but it was packed per usual so we decided to play at Morts instead. They’ve remodeled, it’s still divey but less so. Played for a few hours.

	Met up with Dustin and Camille at Morts (twice in a day) for a few and then went back to their bed and breakfast at 300 Clifton Ave. The place was a mansion and was pretty incredible. We hung out in he game room, played some pool/foosball, and then ubered home.

	Go West - The King of Wishful Thinking

	2/18

	Drank a pint of whiskey, took a nap, and then went to McDonalds. Cool life.

	Finished Shameless with Lacey and bummed around the house all day. Cleaned a little bit.

	2/19 x1

	Back to day one. Also starting keto again since I’m getting fat af (218lbs and my goal weight is 180, yikes). I seriously need to take my health more importantly. Back to see Dr. Johnson today, I feel like my mental state has been better, just need to get this addiction under control. 

	DON’T FUCKING SINK.

	Had my meeting with Barb and briefly discussed my alcoholism, she prescribed me a new drug, Naltrexone, which apparently helps “free you of your dependence on opiate drugs or alcohol”.  

	So far no cravings. We had our last broomball game and tied the team in 4th 1-1. I think we ended the season in second. 

	David was being a dick and playing dirty, he got thrown out of the game.

	Also started Keto today.

	2/20 x2

	Subbed for Sarah Drebelbis/Matt Sprung’s vb team and lost all three games. Then had our own games and lost 2 of 3. I was also super sick and weak during our final games, I think a combination of lack of sleep, keto, and that new medication. Woof.

	2/21 x3

	Feeling anxious again, a bit depressed. Massive headaches. Took a nap after work and then watched the Meru documentary with L on Netflix.

	2/22 x4 - Thurs

	Feeling foggy, antisocial, down. Work is boring and I’d rather just be alone today. L and I booked a ski trip for Afton this weekend but it looks like it might snow, I’m still all for it but we’ll see what she thinks.

	2/23 - Fri x5

	Was in the liquor store today with a bottle of whiskey in my hand and got a text from L that said I didn’t need it. I put it down and went home without buying anything. Small steps.

	2/24 - Sat

	Lacey and I took a day trip over to the Afton Alps to get some skiing practice in before our Colorado trip. We got up early and hit the road around 8:30 and arrived around 9:30 or so to stand in line for a good hour to get all of our gear. 

	Finally hit the slopes around 10:30. We started off slow, Lacey was nervous but got over it quickly as we started to go down tougher runs. Quickly went from green, to blue, and ended the day even doing some blacks! 

	The weather was great but started to snow around 4 so we decided to hit the road so we didn’t get stuck. We wanted to go to Porches at 7th St. but it sold out :( so we stayed home and watched cops instead. Great day!

	2/25 - Sun

	Stayed home all day. Lacey went to a movie. 

	2/26 - Mon x1

	Walked outside to head to work to discover that our car was towed so I spent my morning bussing/walking to the impound lot to take care of that fiasco. $200 wasted. 

	Got a few new hot sauces (big fats, purple hippo, and painapple) so I made chicken wings. 

	2/27

	The internet was down at Rocket today so we were all told we could wfh so I seized the opportunity. I took advantage of the day and drove to Tonkadale Gardens in Minnetonka to get Lacey a birthday present (a giant 4-5 foot cactus). Also made a few quick stops, closed my accounts at wells fargo finally, got L a bday card, and got the car washed. 

	Had L “open” her present early, which was just wrapped in plastic bags, since I didn’t feel like a closet was a great place for a giant cactus to live for a couple days.

	Lost 2 of 3 volleyball games.

	Bodhi gave us an engagement present, a fat sack of weed.

	2/28

	Still going strong with Keto, 15 lbs down in a week and a half. Can’t let myself get back up to 220 ever again. Planning on going to the gym tonight after work but am feeling a bit anxious/cloudy today so we’ll see.

	3/1

	Lacey’s bday today, we’re planning on getting some cocktails and have a reservation for Pizzeria Lola tonight at 8.

	Pizza Lola was a success, meatball appetizer, la crema and a Korean bbq pizza, and a diy ice cream sammich for dessert.

	Defrones - Digital Bath

	“Tonight I feel like more”

<h3>MARCH 2018</h3>

	3/1

	Lacey’s 29th bday. We met at Home after work and drove to Dave and Buster’s to hang out a little bit before our reservation at Pizzeria Lola at 8. Lacey stopped at Madewell and got some earwigs and we got some pretzel bites to snack on.

	Pizzeria Lola was delicious as usual, we ordered the meatballs to start and then I got the Korean BBQ and she got her favorite, Le Crema. Topped it off with the DIY ice cream sandwich and got a photo booth picture taken to hang on the wall.

	We didn’t feel like going home yet so we got a night cap at Stray Dog (previously Bull Dog) in NE. 

	3/2

	Mark and Lori made a trip to town and got in around 3 or so. We hopped around town, took them to Updown and then played some shuffleboard at New Bohemia before we drove out to Roseville to get some Mongolian grill at Khans. We all left uncomfortably full.

	3/3

	Brunch at Chimborazo, L and I split the Llapongachos.. cheesy potato pancakes with pulled pork. So fucking good but I overate.

	Costco/Trader Joe’s day trip to load up on essentials (mostly meat). Parted ways with Mark and Lori after that and spent the rest of our Saturday napping.

	3/4

	Naps/cops/Costco food prep/bills.

	3/5 x1

	I worked from home due to a forecasted snow storm, we hardly got any. The day flew by and before I knew it we were in bed watching cops. Story of our lives.

	3/6
	Lost 2 of 3 vb games but played well with 5. Sold all Lacey’s BTC/XRP/BCH for VEN. 15k.

	3/7
	Hung out and packed after work. 

	3/8

	Early-ish flight for Lacey and I into DIA. Got in and went straight to the bar for some free priority pass drinks. I got scotch and she got a coffee drink.

	David had an earlier flight so Paul met him at the airport for lunch. We met up with them and made our way to Morrison to pick up Ashley before we headed to Copper Mountain.

	Got in and explored the village a bit which was much better than the village at Winter Park.. a lot more variety and the vibe overall was just more chill. We all decided to stop and get a few shots where we overheard a story about a dude who broke both of his femurs just days before.. David especially didn’t like hearing that.

	We then moved on to get our cultural fix at a Mexican restaurant for some queso and margaritas. Got a good buzz going and went to the Irish pub for some car bombs.

	After getting some groceries and booze it was off to the hot tub. The door locked at 10 and we got locked in so we all had to climb the fence to get out, we survived.

	3/9 - Fri
	Skiing day one. Started off at American Flyer and took David down his first run, The Roundabout. He struggled, fell a bunch, but made it down. We ended up getting separated but found some of the others and skies with them for a while. Got into some harder terrain on the Beeline and Lacey fell a couple times so she was kind of over it at that point but I continued with Ryan, Anna, and Eli for the rest of the day.

	Went up the Rendezvous lift at one point where there were great views.. the day was perfectly clear and sunny.

	By the time we were done for the day we  were all pooped. Hit the hot tub and then  got some really good pizza served by a methed our waitress at the A-Line and came home and crashed hard.

	3/10
	Skiing day 2. Super sore. Hit the lifts early again, started on American Flyer and took a few runs with David who had already improved a ton since the day before. Intercepted Paul, Ashley, and Eli and skies a few blues with them.

	Met up midday at the Trex cafe at the base of the Timberline for a group ski shot and a beer before heading back up. 

	Paul and I branched off at one point, and took the Sierra lift to the top.. the views were pretty crazy even though it was windy and cloudy. We ripped down a blue and we’re cruising but I caught an edge and ate shit.. right on my hand. I thought for a second that I broke my wrist but turned out I just bruised up my hand a bit. 

	We finished up going through the terrain park where I did a few jumps! Lacey and I caught the very last lift of the day on American Flyer and when we reached the bottom Biz Markie was performing on the outdoor stage.. he was terrible. Bbbbbbenny and the Jets.

	We hit the Irish pub in the village with everyone and of course got more shots. David and I ran the foosball table against a brother sister duo and we drank some pretty bomb beers - Renegade - The Juice Is Loose. 

	Tried to hot tub after hours but the cover was on so we went back, finished off some whiskey and played “the drawing game”.

	3/11
	Got up and packed, Eli hit the slopes one last time. We were all feeling pretty hungover, but somehow decided to hit some bars after we got back to Morrison.

	“Let’s go to the bar so we don’t sit around and be pieces of shit all day” - Paul

	Stopped into the West Hill Grill to play some darts but there was a poker tournament set up so we got some MORE Irish Carbombs and played buck hunter, Lacey and I won.

	We then got some brunch at The No Name Grill and played darts. Issac met up with us there and then we went back to Paul’s to BBQ after a quick stop at the grocery.

	Nick and Tommy stopped briefly to say hello, Nick just had a kid and Tommy and his wife are pregnant. We all played bags and just hung out and drank a bottle of sambucca. After dinner we watched Paul and Ashley’s wedding video and naked and afraid then all crashed pretty hard.

	3/12 - mon

	Got ready and played some MARIO on Paul’s switch. Paul drove Lacey, David, and I downtown to Union Station to get some brunch at Snooze before we had to take the train to the airport but the wait was pretty long so Lacey and I ended up just grabbing our tickets and making our way to DIA. We used our priority pass (again) at the Timberline Grille for some free lunch and drinks. 

	Made it home after listening to some complete guide followed by some very angry babies on the plane.

	Lacey spontaneously went and bought a switch and played it all night, so was so excited! Also binge ate some Taco Bell and watched cops, back to reality yet again.

	3/13

	Started a dev project that I designed for Vivacity Tech. Won our two tournament vb games.

	3/14

	Idk

	3/15

	Love marathon.

	3/16 - Fri

	Lacey and I both worked from home. I got some chores done around the house. We met up with a few r55 (Angelina, Sumia, Evan/Ellen, Bodhi, and Nelson/Hannah) coworkers at Moose for a happy hour. Discussed proposals, vacations, and hot sauces.

	3/17

	Pretty sleepy morning. I convinced Lacey to go on a bike ride to play pinball since it was so nice out, she was apprehensive but ended up enjoying it. We biked to Tilt in Whittier but it was packed as usual so we decided to just pick up some whiskey and go play in the basement of Caffetto. 

	Sampled some really good gins and ryes from Dampfwerk at Humms and then went and play some Fish Tales, caught a few monsters.

	We then made way to the Wedge and got some delicious but overpriced smoked Gouda string cheese and procioutto to take to Laurie’s at Center Village.

	Played a couple of games of pool and beat both Ryan and Brett at ping pong.

	Got a drink at the hotel bar (rich man’s kitchen as Ryan likes to call it) then stopped at the Depot for some wings/snacks before seeing Godspeed You! Black Emporer at the main room. It was great seeing them as always.

	Saw a couple old Fargo friends after the show, Troy Gion and Brandon Schiwal.

	3/18

	Made coffee as L did her taxes. She went to a movie and I stuck around home and played Mario on the switch. David stopped by before going to his brothers new coffee shop; The Daily.

	I prepped some food for the week, still going strong on keto.

	We watched a couple episodes of Love, the cops, then crashed to the sleep with me podcast... “Ladies and gentlemen, boyyys and girls, and friends from beyondddd the binary..”

	3/19 - Monday

	Took a nap post work to wake up to the smell of chicken pad thai. I couldn’t eat it due to my xnoxcarbxlifestylex so I made some sausages and jalapeño poppers. 

	Almost finished season 3 of Love and of course, again, watched a stupid amount of cops while joking that we should both get cops/bad boys tattoos.

	3/20

	Making good progress on my Vivacity website. Volleyball tournament continues tonight at 7.

	VET officially locked up in the strength node x today, now we just need it to spike to about $50 and we’ll be millionaires.
	 
	3/21
	Worked from spyhouse. 

	3/22

	Lacey had her annual review this morning and to her surprise got a 6k bonus and a 2% raise. Bringing homeee the bacon!

	Stray Dog happy hour to celebrate, broke my keto streak and ate mass quantities of carbs. Onion rings and tots. Stopped at Moose for a quick shot and then home to bed because we’re old.

	3/23

	Finished Vivacity Tech today and got a bunch of compliments on it. Day’s off to a good start. It’s Angelina’s last day so we’re all going to get RayJays for lunch and doing a post work happy hour at Able.

	RayJays was decent but my wings were maybe the sloppiest I’ve ever had and we’re too sweet (Asian Zing). I discovered wing sauce shrapnel all over my sweatshirt when I got back to work. 

	Pretty unproductive last hour or so and then the r55 crew all met up at Able for a few, Lacey met us there. We almost got kicked out for taking fireball pills in the brewery. 

	Lacey and I split off and got philly and fries as Uncle Frankie’s that we waited like an hour for, L says it wasn’t that long but it def felt like it. 

	We met the remaining party at Lush, got a drink and landed at Vegas Lounge where we played some pool and hung out before heading home.

	3/24

	Very lazy Saturday. We got McDonalds for lunch and Pizza Hut for dinner, we’re disgusting. 

	Hung around Home, took some naps, played switch, and then watched Predator.

	“Dilllllonnnn, you son of a bitch”

	3/25

	Sake bloodies at Moto I, Lacey was very happy about that. She also got some pork buns.

	We tried to play pinball at UpDown but it was so fucking loud in there so we left and went to Morts instead where we at least knew we could play undisturbed. I scored my second high on Attack - 7.9B. 

	After that we decided we probably shouldn’t spend any more money and hung out at home for the rest of the day. 

	Watched Encino Man.

	3/26 - Mon

	Learned a lot about GIT today at work, starting to understand branching more.

	Made a keto spaghetti with miracle noodles and started watching the documentary series “Wild Wild Country” about the cult leader Bagwhan Rajneesh. 

	3/27

	Met Lacey, David, and the girl David is seeing off and on (Olivia) in Cedar/Riverside after work for a couple drinks before the Nils Frahm show at the Cedar. Made a pit stop at Palmers for some whiskey but the atmosphere sucked and it was super loud so we hung out at the Nomad instead. We were the only people in the bar. Randomly ran into UX Brent from Capella in line as we waited to get in.

	Nils was incredible as expected, he played mostly stuff off of All Melody but did play Hammers and a couple from Spaces. He looked like a mad scientist while he jumped around the stage frantically playing multiple pianos and adjusting the mixers. Of course he cracked jokes.. mostly about how routine encores are.

	Lacey and I bought vinyl after and got it signed.. we were both so awkward but I’m glad we did it.

	3/28

	BAGWAHN

	3/29

	WFH, called about my insurance and found out it fucking sucks. Got my haircut at Aveda by a girl who had hardly any idea what she was doing, luckily the instructor fixed me up. 

	Martinis and a cheese platter. Found some really good olives and blue cheese at surdyks.

	3/30



	3/31

	Pinball at Morts, Lacey got eggs benny for brunch and it looked/smelled surprisingly good. Found out that the Aerosmith pin is actually pretty damn fun. Walked to the uptown theater to see Isle of Dogs but it was sold out so without any other adequate plans we just went home and spent the day there napping.

	I about burned the house down with bacon grease.

	Did some grocery shopping later on, filled the co2 for the soda stream, and Lacey got some Taco Bell.

<h2>APRIL 2018</h2>
	————-

	4/1 - Sunday x1

	Weather was shit so I played video games for a majority of the day, beat Super Mario Odyssey. Did some chores, made a massive amount of Keto broccoli soup, finished Wild Wild Country, and watched two full movies (Superbad and Honey I Shrunk Ourselves). Productive media day. 

	Lacey and I “celebrated” our Easter with some sliced ham.

	4/2 - Mon x2
	Watching: Spinal Tap

	Finally back in Ketosis after a carb filled mayhem the weekend prior. Fat as fuck again, 216lbs. Goal weight is still 180, hopefully once I start running again it’ll fall off.

	The weather is garbage so probably not happening in the immediate future.

	4/3 - Tues
	Watching: Blind Date (guilty pleasure)

	Got a bunch of snow overnight, pretty crummy outside. Shrimp scampaaaaaiiii.

	4/4 - Wed

	Had a design/wp training meeting with Vivacity Tech today, I think it went pretty well. They usually go ok despite my utter fear or presenting. I’m 31 and still waiting to grow out of that. 

	Long RL session with David after work. 

	“Your Dad write those lyrics for ya?”

	4/5
	Watching: Factotum

	“I’ve probably slept longer than youve lived”

	“As we live we all get caught and torn by various traps”

	Spyhouse to work some but my computer died and I forgot my charger so came home for some lunch.

	Macaroni and sausage with miracle noodles, how I haven’t thought of that yet is beyond me.

	Sitting on the bus in a hazy daze, looking but not looking. It’s meditative. Brainless.

	We decided to go to the Twins’ home opener at Target Field vs the Mariner’s. Meeting Lacey at O’Donovan’s for a pregame drink.

	We scalped tickets for $20 since the nosebleeds were $45.. we ended up getting lower section seats on the first baseline not far from the dugout. Saw Ichiro for the first time since we didn’t catch him at Safeco. Witnessed 3 Home runs and we won the game.

	4/6 - Fri

	Walked to Spring street and got some onion rings and a couple beverages and landed on tacos and margaritas at Adelitas for dinner. It was pretty low key and quiet. We ordered some chips and queso alongside some tacos.. The food was memorable as well as the squeaky booth Lacey was sitting in. Got Had a jalapeño that surprisingly burnt my face off, maybe I’m not as tough as I thought 🤨

	4/7 

	Stopped around NE trying to find a single coffee shop with an open table, struck out at both 5 Watt and Spyhouse before landing at Anelace. I worked on my portfolio and Lacey read. We sat by (yet again) another fighting couple, why we attract them I do not know. Awkward.

	Had to pick up a softball sponsorship check so we got a quick appetizer at Mac’s and decided to just stop for some liquor and go play video games at home.

	4/8

	Ready Player One at St. Anthony Main. I was actually pretty excited to see it since I read and loved the book. 

	I have to say, the movie was terrible. Spielberg murdered it and caked on his brand of cringeworthy blockbuster bullshit. I couldn’t wait for it to end, it seriously felt like I was watching Spykids. 

	L and I made a homemade bbq pulled pork pizza and watched Periscope Down, which was also unfortunately terrible despite getting good reviews from Paul. 

	0 for 2 on the day.

	4/9

	Drunken notes to myself:

	Addiction is fucked up. Some days I can overcome it but others it’s like I’m just going through the motions with little to no control. I drove to the liquor store after work despite knowing it’s a terrible decision. I’m seriously going to drink myself to death if this keeps up. 

	Crazy to think that I was predestined for a life of mental health issues and addictive tendencies. Another reason to consider not having children, I would hate to subject any person to this sort of despair. The good days are good but the bad are really fucking tough.

	The thing is, I don’t want to be like this but I sure as hell (don’t know how) have a hard time to not be.

	I talk to L about it some times but I:
	1. don’t want to hurt her
	2. don’t want to disappoint her
	3. don’t want to anger her
	4. don’t want to scare her

	Reasons not to drink: 
	1. Look at yourself in the gd mirror
	2. You will die a horrible agononizing cancerous death
	3. Pathetic that you can’t have the self control it takes not to

	4/10

	Another pathetic day, I went home from work early because I was hungover and couldn’t focus. Drank for a few hours, ate dinner, and passed out. 

	4/11

	Woke up and drank the rest of the whiskey. Contemplated dumping it out but go figure. Tomorrow is a new day.

	4/12 x1

	Grilled up some steaks and watched a documentary about the mass murderer Richard Kuklinski “The Ice Man”, was pretty decent but got a bit long. Some people man.. this world is full of crazies.

	4/13 x2

	Read a study that drinking 2 drinks above the recommended max a day will cut your life short to the same extent a cigarette does.. IWNDWYT

	Supposedly getting 8-12” of snow tonight.. could really use some sun. Probably a snowed in weekend of gaming ahead.

	Friday the 13th, maybe I can actually convince L to watch some horror movies with me?

	We watched the Descent, finally. I think I jumped more than she did! 

	4/14 x3

	Woke up early with some intense stomach pains, most likely due to the ghost peppers I ate last night.

	Decided to try smoking the pax and playing Mario, already starting to feel my eyes getting heavy.

	When I smoked regularly when I lived with Davidx2 I remember not drinking as much, losing weight, and actually feeling motivated so maybe I can at least replace one unhealthy vice with another less-unhealthy vice. Just hoping I don’t get the anxiety/paranoia that usually accompanies it for me.

	Finished the book Rumble Fish and fell back asleep.

	Update: Anxiety still exists, hence why I don’t smoke week. Worth a shot I guess.

	Heavy snow in the cities this weekend, it snowed all day. We decided to brave the storm and make a trip to target so we could get Zelda: BOTW and some supplies for our reclusive weekend.

	I read the Dennis Rodman autobiography “Bad As I Want To Be” while L adventures Hyrule.

	4/15 - Sun x4

	Still snowing, we got over 12” this weekend, possibly more. So much for spring.

	Another day in playing video games and reading.. kind of both of our dream days really.

	Made some chicken wings (drummies actually) and watched Game Over Man and the new Silicon Valley episodes.

	4/16 x5

	Launching Vivacity Tech today, hoping everything goes smoothly.

	Discovering that I really enjoy reading, something that drinking essentially prohibits me from doing regularly.

	4/17 x6

	Finished “Bad as I Want To Be” and started on “World War Z”. So far so good.

	Couldn’t sleep so I crashed on the couch, for the second night in a row.

	4/18

	I threw a pork shoulder in the crock pot and then met up with Lacey for happy hour at Moose. She order JL Beers, we walked there as I talked to Mom on the phone. They got her order wrong (of course) so we had to go back and pick up her chips, I stopped for a few beers and we headed home to watch some Naked and Afraid.

	4/19

	Got my Raspberry Pi today and immediately started setting it up. I didn’t have a wired keyboard so I had to figure out a way to SSH into it from my laptop but finally managed to get in and make some updates. Hoping to set up RetroPi this weekend!

	4/20

	Going to “Adult Night” at the zoo tonight with David, Olivia, Dustin, and Camille. Should be fun but all I really want to do is fuck around with my Pi.

	The zoo was pretty fun, once we got there.. 40 minute drive. Didn’t get to see a whole lot, saw some snow monkeys, flamingos, touched some leopard sharks.

	Continued our night at Psycho Suzies, David bought the big firey drink “Leilani’s Firebowl” and we go a pizza and curds. Was feeling pretty wasted by the time we finished up the drinks but Camille wanted to keep the party rolling so we went to Betty Dangers (got a prickly pear) and then capped the night at Tony Jaros.

	4/21

	Prettayyy hungover tbh. The day was beautiful, sunny and in the 60’s. L and I hung out at New Bohemia and people watched outside.. spring brings out all the crazies! Got a quick drink at Macs, stopped at Lunds for some Taco ingredients and picked up some margarita supplies.

	We made carne asada tacos and they were amazing! Of course alongside a couple margs and queso ;)

	4/22

	Another gorgeous day, L and I biked to St Louis Park where we were eventually going to meet up with the tripod and see Super Troopers 2. We hung out at Punch Bowl Social for a bit, sat in some comfy chairs and then met up with everyone at Coopers for some apps.

	Ploughman’s Platter.

	Onion tower.

	Bike ride home.. 16 miles on the day, not bad for our first time out! I got pho and L got some punch.

	4/23 x1

	Super tired after work, so many chores to do but nothing got done besides a good Zelda sesh.

	4/24

	Had my “annual” review today with Nelson and Evan which was really more like my 14 month review due to it being rescheduled like 6 times. Overall it went really well, I got a lot of positive feedback and was reassured that I’ve been doing a great job at Rocket. They even referred to me as a “trailblazer” since I’m both a designer and developer. 

	I asked for the raise I was promised over a year ago.. told them I was expecting 5k and I should know within the next couple weeks.

	Made another pork shoulder and whipped up a bbq pulled pork pizza and we TRIED to watch PeeWee’s Adventure but it was seriously unbearably annoying so we turned it off halfway. We decided to listen to Scooter’s version instead on the Sleep With Me podcast.

	4/25

	4/26

	4/27

	Lacey’s family get together at her aunt Cindy’s for some pizza along with Lori, Pam, and her grandma. Met her cousin Matt and his wife Bethany. The pizza was mediocre and there were loud children everywhere but it was pretty decent overall except we were both tired as hell and those ladies will talk your ear off. Finally made it out without literally passing out from mental exhaustion.

	4/28

	Beautiful sunny day. Lacey and I bounced around northeast. Pho for lunch at Pho 400 in New Brighton which was actually pretty good despite the tinted windows and stale decor. Thrifted a bit at unique and found some good books and decided to stop at Dangerous Man for a pb porter (when we arrived we discovered that Lacey massively ripped her pants and her ass was hanging out with bright red underwear so we had to go home and change before returning). Stopped at madre cacti to look for a friend for spike, checked out a couple shops on central, got some sour beers at Fairstate, explores Headflyer Brewery, and ended at Spring Street for a few drinks in the patio. Busy day!

	“Even this fuckin little baby looks better in a baseball cap than I do” - Lacey 

	“Must be the band starting up downstairs” - Lacey (actually hearing a motorcycle leaving from moose”

	“Good job DICKWEED” - grumpy tattooed spring street server

	4/29

	Went for a jog through North Loop and hung out around home while Lacey tried to work at coffee shops but struck out with space and wifi. We went on a nice little walk through Boom Island park and scopes out some future hammock spots by the Mississippi. Really nice night, a lot of people out jogging, walking their dogs, flying kites.

	Grilled up some kabobs and watched Silicon Valley.

	4/30

	WFH in the morning and phone interviewed with Push Interactive, wasn’t really interested in the work so I don’t think I’ll go in if I get asked in for an in person interview.

	Got the $5,000 raise I asked for 🤑 More kabobs and more Silicon Valley. Started Far Cry 5.

<h3>MAY 2018</h3>
	========

	5/1 - Tues

	Woke up early and went for a run in the rain.

	First softball game of the year for Piazza Party, new shirts hot off the press and delivered right to the bench.

	We lost but Lacey got to play with Anna’s new dog so we’ll chalk that up as a win.

	5/2

	Lunchtime jog and post work bike ride to volleyball at memory. Dig Dug back in action. We lost game 1, we looked pretty rusty but pulled it together and won 2 of 3.

	Grilled up some chicken and watched Gringo, the John McAfee documentary. Learned he was a freak and has a scat fetish.

	5/3

	Moose pregame before softball which was a bust because the other team only had 5. We scrimmaged but it was a huge waste of time. Got together at Stanley’s after, Leah is in town for a few days so got to see her for a bit.

	5/4

	Sooooo tired, activities 4 nights a week is super draining. Stayed in.

	5/5

	L and I decided to host a Cinco De Mayo gathering at our place. We made a huge batch of tacos, queso, and margaritas for everyone. Ryan, Anna, Leah,Brett, Korman, Pat, David, Olivia, and Matt came by. We played kubb after the rain passed.

	Anna brought her new pup Vera so Huey got to meet her for the first time, it went alright for a while but he definitely lost his patience after a while.

	Everyone started filtering out around 10 so Lacey and I made a stop at Evan’s housewarming party, just long enough to kick some ass in beer pong.

	We got a night cap at 331 with David and Olivia, she was clearly ready for bed. 

	We saw my old coworker Marin there, she seemed to be tweaking on something.

	Stopped at SA on our hazy walk back and dominated a pizza before bed.

	“You knowww, I’m not loving that cigar”

	5/6

	May Day Parade at Powderhorn. Hung out on the hill by the main ceremony. Got some curds, a corn dog, and a gyro. Such a great day to hang out in the park.

	We got real gross and went to Wendy’s on our way home. I got a Baconator and L got a Son of Baconator. Pretty sure I got food poisoning from mine.. I should have known better considering the restaurant was filthy and full of obese subhumans. Never again.

	5/7

	I live my life, at most times, just waiting for something great to happen. Like my current situation is only a fraction of the true potential it has. I hate being a slave to labor, I wish I could come and go as I choose.

	4 mike run to uptown. UpDown pinballs. ABags league night one. Caffreys Blue Cow.

	5/8

	R55 10 year anniversary today, I won $50 in a drawing and they catered Famous Dave’s BBQ for lunch. 

	Softball tonight at 6:15 but it’s supposed to thunderstorm.

	Had our game against Knight Cap, won pretty easily and post gamed at Spring Street after striking out at Bauhaus, Indeed, and Able.

	Brett was drinking again, apparently was drunk after work and lying about it. Showed up to the game late and was visibly intoxicated. He was also sneaking shots at the bar like we wouldn’t be able to tell.

	5/9

	Ran to memory lanes for our volleyball game, won all 3. 

	New bartender/servor combo is weak, I miss Justin and Don!

	5/10

	Morning jog, finally under 9 minute miles again. Worked from Caffetto for a bit with Lacey/played some Iron Maiden pinball.

	Took a nap before meeting up with Clarkson, Luke, Digs, and Korman at Moose.

	Got 10 run ruled, wasn’t pretty. I went 3-3.

	5/11

	Had a decent day at work.. bday celebration for Rachel consisted of a taco bar and margaritas. Was introduced to a new game - Tellistrations and it was pretty hilarious.

	Bought a few beers to have at home while I played video games.. Lacey wasn’t in the mood for that and gave me a piece of her mind. Mostly that she is worried about how much I drink. That makes two of us.

	Don’t sink.

	5/12

	Met up with Dan from work at the Fulton warehouse for the Gran Fondo block party. His gf Sam was working so we all got free beers. Headed out when it started to sprinkle to get ready for Pat and Maggie’s (belated) house warming party.

	5/13 - Sun

	Pizza date lunch at Parkway Pizza, they claim to be the “best ever” with the “best sausage ever”.. pretty bold claims. The pizza was good but the best? Nah.

	Hung out in BF Nelson Park for a bit, Lacey set up the hammock and read a bit. Since the hammock only fits one and I didn’t really feel like rolling around in the grass I went home and took a snooze by the open window, same thing right? 

	Got some Zelda BotW in after calling mom to wish her a happy mother’s day. 

	Fell asleep to Bob Ross.

	5/14

	Planned on a run to our bags game but it decided to rain instead. Slightly bummed but slightly relieved at the same time. Played a bit of Zelda, ate a quesadilla, and watched a VERY lackluster season premiere of Westworld Season 2. 

	Bob Ross again. Learned that he has a pet squirrel named Peapod.

	5/15
	🎵 - Jets To Brazil - Chinatown

	Morning 5k.

	Softball win. 3 run bomb, first homer of the season for me. Last year I had ~20+ so I have some work to do. We 10 run ruled Whadugijumon.

	5/16
	🎵 - Tigers Jaw - Spirit Desire

	5k to Memory Lanes in the 80+ degree heat, needless to say I was dead by the time I got there. Met L in the parking lot and basked in some AC for a few minutes before changing and making way to the Hexagon for a couple pre game drinks.

	They had bingo and a meat raffle going on, very midwest of them. After shooting the shit with some barflies we closed out our tab and went to the game; no contest 3-0.

	“See yah in Colorado - I’ll throw ya a frisbee and it’ll have a “brownie” on it” - Hilarious random produce patron

	5/17
	🎵 - Tycho - Horizon (Poolside Remix)

	Got off work early to go fishing with Donny. We found a nice little spot down by the stone arch bridge right on the Mississippi. We didn’t have a lot of time and we struggled with setting up our rods for a bit but when the sun started to set I caught a little pike using my new skitter pop top water bait. 

	Bryce met us down there for a minute before they had to go to band practice.

	Met Dignan at Moose for one before our softball game; we 10 run ruled 1029.. everyone played really well.

	5/18

	National pizza day today apparently, we got pizza (Dominoes) catered to the office. We fly out of MSP tonight.

	Preflight fireball as is tradition. Had a layover in Kansas City for a couple hours, ate some Pizza Hut and slept for most of it. Finally got to our hotel a little after 11, munched some Burger King, and to bed.

	5/19 - Sat

	Straight to the hot tub when we woke up before getting ready and hitting up the continental breakfast. Hyatt House know what’s up.. waffle makers and an omelet bar.

	“I had a dream that I was a guy, from Pakistan, like whattttttt?!” - L

	Paul and Ashley were just getting in from Watertown for Paul’s dads retirement party so they were able to pick us up and take us back to Morrison. We stopped at Bob’s atomic Burger in Littleton for, what might be the best burger I’ve had. I got the daily special which was a gyro burger with lamb meat and it was perfectly crispy like a Culver’s butter burger. Delicious. We then made way to Boulder to meet up with Eli, Ryan, Brett, and Korman.

	Checked out Eli’s new place. Ryan was already passed out on the couch from his excessive thc consumption. 

	We finally arrived at Eli’s coworkers air bnb “The Moose Manor” after a long twisty road up the mountain in snowy conditions.

	“It was like a nightmare rollercoaster” - Ryan

	It was wet and snowy so we pretty much stayed in all night and played games (Tellistrations). Short trip to town for a junk food stockpile. 

	We downed 5 pizzas and crashed.

	5/20 - Sun

	West Hill Grille Attack From Mars for a few morning libations. The entire place reeks like wet feet. I guess that’s the result of carpeting your bar.

	Paul and Ashley took us to Toast, a popular breakfast spot in Littleton. We had an hour wait time so we snagged a quick bloody at a bar nearby first. 

	Toast was incredible, I got the fried chicken and pancakes which was all smothered in sausage gravy and syrup. Omg. L got the prosciutto benedict, good but way too salty. Adam met us there.

	We spent a majority of our day after breakfast at round 1 barcode and bowling alley. Drank a shitload of $3 24oz beers and played about $40 worth of games and a few “semi-failed” photo booth attempts.

	Despite how god damn full I/we was/were we decided to get fondue at the melting pot. 

	5/21 - Mon

	Paul and Ashley had to work during the day so L and I ubered to Boulder to do some exploring. We walked around Pearl bouncing around some shops, I was looking for sunglasses but struck out.

	We got some bloodies on the Lazy Dog rooftop and got some bacon wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese which were pretty bomb.

	Got some margs and chips at Centro and had a really strange peanut based salsa.

	Lacey got some gelato and Ashley came and picked us up and took us to meet up with Paul at Tony Rigatoni for a few beers and charcuterie plate before dropping us off at Red Rocks for Tycho.

	The hike up to red rocks was a lot tougher than anticipated.. we finally made it, short of breath.

	Met up with the rest of the crew just in time for Tycho to go on.. the view was spectacular but we both felt that the sound wasn’t the best. They still put on a decent show but seeing them at the Palace was still my favorite.

	Phantogram was a bit weak IMO and we were far enough back where we could hardly see so we left just a few songs in.

	5/22 - Tues

	Blah, full day of traveling back to Mpls.. 

	So much driving in CO, we don’t ever want to live in a suburb and have to commute. Got to Union Station safe after our stoned Garth-Brooks-fan uber driver missed like 5 turns.

	Another layover in Kansas City..

	Finally got home and went straight to Taco Bell for a night cap.

	5/23 

	Back to work and groggy as hell. Went to the river with L before volleyball to fish.. got my popper stuck in a tree so that was awesome. Then I got my walk lure stuck in the same tree but it was luckily hanging down to the water so I threw on a new crankbait to try to snag it. I latched on to the walk lure and superrr luckily it pulled my popper out of the tree too! No fish but a little excitement.

	Won 2 of 3 volleyball games against the team we were tied with for 1st.

	5/24

	Had a kickoff meeting with John Woodland from TART Optical (known for being the eyewear of choice for James Dean/Johnny Depp and more). Dude seemed baked out of his mind or just extremely ADD. Most unproductive meeting I’ve ever been in.

	L dropped me off at St. Anthony to fish while she ran to the mall. I caught a little small mouth before a storm rolled in and absolutely dumped on me. Softball was cancelled.

	5/25

	Adelitas for a Mexican dinner with Lacey, Lori, and Mark. I got chicken wings because keto.

	5/26 - Sat

	I got my haircut in the morning at “The Barber Sharpe”. They have a live cam which they all got a kick out of, the ended up watching me get my haircut.

	We all walked to the farmers market in NE and browsed around. Got some cold press, some pickled habeneros, asparagus, and a nice big flowery plant for the front porch.

	Took the “in laws” to Punch Pizza. I got the Punch salad.

	Made a Costco trip and bought like 50 pounds of meat. We were there for what felt like forever since Lori and Mark found a Traeger grill on sale, which they ended up buying. Lacey’s Aunt Cindy also wanted one so we had to wait for her to come and pick it up too. 

	Grilled up some burgers and dogs and ate out on the front deck.

	5/27 - Sun

	Lacey woke up with a massive migraine. I made a frittata with leftover grilled veggies. Lori and Mark decided to drive back to Iowa, I think they were just really excited to get the new Traeger up and running. 

	The brought along their “car caddy” so we finally got the POS Chevy Malibu out of our driveway. Good riddance.

	L and I drove down to Lake Nokomis to fish and hang out. No fish, way too hot. The beach and the trails were all packed with people everywhere and we were getting pretty hot so we left. 

	Stopped into Morts for a few and a couple quick games of pinball. 

	Made way to the river, a new spot over by the Plymouth bridge. I tested out my new spook and caught a smallmouth.

	5/28 - Mon

	Memorial Day. Hot as balls, 95 degrees plus. L and I packed up and explored Silver Lake up by New Brighton. It was a really nice, calm, residential lake with a clean beach and a unpopulated fishing dock. I fished a bit while Lacey read in a hammock.

	No fish but 1 bite. Way too hot I assume.

	I had bags at Herk at 6:45, it was slightly rainy but we still played and won all 3.  

	Came home and grilled like 5 pounds of meat and went to bed so I could get up early for my interview.

	5/29 - Tues

	I got up early and interviewed at the stable downtown. It went really well and I think I might take the position if I get an offer. I asked for 80k which would set me up 25% in pay this year and I’d literally be across the skyway from Lacey.

	Thunderstorms during the afternoon, with uncertainty about whether or not we’d have a softball game we all decided to stay home. 

	Had some Moscow Mules and played RL with David.

	5/30

	Got some new lures in the mail so I decided to take them out for a spin before volleyball. Lacey joined me and we went down to Bassett Creek. 

	She immediately had a few bites and before too long she caught a decent sized smallmouth on a spook. It was slightly sprinkling so the fish were active. We saw a ton jumping. I caught a smallmouth shortly after with my new whopper plopper.

	I of course got my popper stuck in a tree a few feet from shore, I contemplated leaving it but ultimately decided to man up and walk in to get it. 

	Volleyball could have been better, we played with 5 and lost all 3.

<h3>JUNE 2018</h3>
	—————-

	6/1 - Fri

	Spent the work day making Wordpress training videos for cherrywood point, brainless but the day went by fast.

	Made way to boom island park afterwards with L for the typical hammock/fishing routine. Got skunked but it was a great night to be out.

	Hung around home and watched some dateline NBC with Chris Hansen.

	6/2

	Woke up to rain. Started the day off meal prepping a pork shoulder and some bacon.

	We were bored so we did some bar hopping in NE. Spring Street for one and then Sopranos pinball at Vegas lounge. Lacey got carded twice since they thought she was 18.

	Walked to Lunds for some groceries and spend the rest of the evening at home.

	6/3

	Drove to Lake Calhoun to do some canoeing and fishing but realized that it was far too windy so we decided to grab some coffee at 5 Watt instead. Spontaneously popped into the Mercado Mexican market next door and bought some hot sauces and cheese.

	Played some pinball at updown, scopes out Extreme Noise and left with a few records.

	Grilled up some meats for some meal prepping and called the parents. 

	6/4

	Too much caffeine yesterday afternoon, was up to late and I feel like shit today. Working on some garbage projects too, just all in all not in a great mood.

	Matt couldn’t play bags so Lacey subbed for him. We won 1 of 3, didn’t play that great but could have been worse.

	6/5 - Tues

	Worked remotely today. Had a job interview/informational with Johanna Ruiz, the technical director over at Brave New Media, at the spyhouse on Nicollet.
	It went really well and it seems like he wants to hire me but has to verify if they can meet my salary expectations.. I asked for 70k.

	Still working on the North Memorial Health project.. such a shit project. Reminds me of thWente production work I loathed over at Capella.. needless to say I was pretty much pissed off all day.

	Found some time to pop into Tilt and play some pinball though.

	Was a super nice night so I went down to the stone arch spot to fish a bit after work to decompress, caught my first rock bass.

	Late softball game which we barely won. I went 4-4.

	6/6 - Wed

	Been in full ketosis for a past week or so.. I can finally fit into some old shirts again. Feels good man. Being fat sucks.

	Went fishing down at the Basset Creek spot with Evan and Dan.. no luck for them but I caught 4 smallies including my PB.

	Late volleyball games, we played like shit but still won all 3.

	6/7

	Slacked off at work for most of the day, needed a mental health day.

	Fished a little on the north side of the Plymouth bridge, no luck, only one bite. Was trying out my buzz bait and my salvo. So much fucking cottonwood cotton everywhere too, it’s so annoying.

	Didn’t help the fishing that the river rats were performing just north of me. It was kind of cool though since I’d never seen a human pyramid on skis before..

	Lost our softball game.

	6/8

	Anthony Bourdain died today, he committed suicide. Such a shame, he was easily my favorite travel host to live vicariously through. Dude was a badass.

	6/9
	L and I considered camping but couldn’t find a spot close enough so we nixed the idea. 

	Instead we went to a happy hour and a movie, Hereditary. I thought the movie was pretty great up until the ending which I’m still unsure of.

	The pre movie happy hour was really good, we went to Origami in uptown. I’m still going strong on keto so I got the sashimi platter. L got some karage and rice, her usual.

	On the bus ride home we got a text from Angelina who wanted us to meet up at Cuzzie’s with her and Sumia. Had a few drinks, talked shop (way too much for Lacey’s liking), and heard all about Sumia’s trips to the boundary waters.

	6/10

	Slept in a little and walked over to the farmers market in the rain. Got some coffees and perused. Left with some asparagus and went home and made eggs Benedict. 

	I was in the market for some new tackle boxes so I found some in Hugo on Craigslist, 30 min north. Luckily someone wanted to buy my N64 and wanted to meet in Coon Rapids so the timing worked out.


	6/11
	Watching: Evil Genius

	Bags game in the rain, lost 2 of 3 to a team comprised of both subs.

	Got a couple shots, played a little pinball at updown, returned the ratchet straps to the the dude who sold us the canoe, and headed home.

	6/12

	Dad turns 60 today, how weird is that.. life is just flying by.  

	Excited to see everyone and get out on the houseboat this weekend.

	Lost our softball game by 1 in the bottom of the 7th. Our team didn’t do too hot but I hit a 2run home run and had a long double.

	6/13

	Vacation brain today. Trying to set up my portfolio site.

	Meeting the fam at memory lanes tonight after work, they wanted to watch our volleyball game.

	We won all 3 of our volleyball games, had a couple drinks with everyone and then reconvened at our house. Lacey and I showered up and got ready and we caught an Uber to Psycho Suzies for a couple cocktails and pizza.

	The night was really nice and sunny. Dad opened his gift, a “what happens on the houseboat stays on the houseboat” shirt and a captain’s hat. He claims that he had no idea and that he was honestly surprised despite our many close calls. He was really excited and it made me really happy to see him as such.

	6/14

	We couldn’t board the boat until 5pm so we putzed around for a bit in the morning and finally hit the road a little after noon. 

	First stop was lunch at Buffalo Wild Wings.. a greasy start to a glutinous weekend for me.

	We hit the road after lunch, Mom hopped along with Lacey and I. The scenery south of the cities reminded me of Lansing area.. very lush with a lot of little buttes and rolling hills. 

	We stopped in Alma to get groceries for the trip.. the typical brats, burgers, and a lot of chips. Another quick stop to get liquor and we finally made way to “Fun in the Sun” to get the run down by our host Nikki before we were able to start settling in. 

	We stayed docked for the evening, did some fishing (I caught 4), watched our instructional video and contemplated our days to come.

	6/15

	Training session with captain Art (Art the Fart as Anton liked to call him). Dad was incredibly nervous, rightfully so considering he was responsible for driving a 750k piece of machinery.

	Art guided us to the first beach where he was going to teach us how to anchor. When landing on the beach, in order to stay at a 90 degree angle it took immense concentration.. the current easily pushed the tail end of the boat down current and Dad was having trouble controlling it. I’ve never seen him so shaken.. and Art didn’t really do a great job making him feel comfortable.

	We finally made it out past the bouey where Art and his trainee were to be picked up and he didn’t seem overly confident that we’d be able to get the hang of it. He asked if Dad wanted one of the “boys” to give it a shot so I stepped in.. did a couple of uturns with relative ease and Art deemed us competent and left us to it. 

	Our first actual beach landing wasn’t the greatest.. positioning the boat on the beach at that 90 degree angle was a lot harder than it looked. Everyone was a bit on edge after our training session and it didn’t help getting conflicting orders.. I was starting to drift since I accidentally put the boat in Neutral and Dad stepped in.. he punched the throttle a little too much and the boat jolted parallel to the beach, on course towards a rock pile. Mom screamed, Dad freaked, and I stepped back in and was actually able to get the boat back perpendicularly. Anton, Katie, and Lacey all hurried out front and manned the anchors and we finally successful got situated.. sighs of relief and drinks to be had immediately in succession.

	We were all finally able to relax.. hung out on the beach a bit, fished a little with no luck, broke in the water slide. Grilled up some burgers for dinner as a thunderstorm rolled in.

	6/16 - Sat

	Woke up relieved that we were still anchored to land. Turned on the generator and made some coffee. The morning was calm and rainy.

	Our plan was ambitious, we wanted to go through the locks and hang out in Wabasha for the day.. but we first had to get off the beach.

	The time finally came and we were ready to “set sail”. The anchors were in and I was doing alright controlling the boat on the beach as I got the all clear. 

	We failed a couple times due to the current pushing my stern downstream and my lack of acceleration so we had to reposition. We ended up calling to get some pointers which they instructed us to rutter hard into the current. I did so and was doing alright but didn’t have enough boost again so we ended up doing more of a 3 point turn but made it out past the boueys in one piece. 

	I was a little flustered after that and wasn’t comfortable going through the locks so we cruised to pool and saw both the north and south locks before we found a beach to land on.. this landing was flawless.

	Another day of sitting around, eating, chatting, swimming, and fishing. Anton found a turtle and I saw an otter.

	I was sick of casting so I set up a river rig and floated a crawler in the current from the top deck. Before long I had a bite and it was fighting hard. I reeled him in for a good few minutes and realized it was a big channel catfish, probably 7-10 pounds, and was definitely the biggest fish I’ve caught to date.

	After having a small fire on the beach, Dad went to bed and the rest of us settled down and played tellestrations and had some good laughs.

	6/17 - Sun

	Lots of driving ahead for all of us so we brought the boat in early to get it cleaned and get on the road.

	I had a perfect departure from the beach and was feeling like I finally had the hang of it. 

	We made it in, Art docked the boat. We had a couple drinks at the campground bar and reminisced a bit before we all headed to Wabasha to check out “Slippery’s”, the bar featured in Grumpy Old Men.

	The bar was nice and the food was decent. I got a crawfish po boy, L got a burger, and Mom/Dad got some catfish that was a bit salty but overall good.

	Made it home finally after the 2 hour drive, I was beat. Said our farewells, L went to the store for some margs and we had even more chips and queso while finishing the Evil Genius documentary.

	Overall a great weekend with family, miss them all already.

	6/18

	Started a 48 hour fast today after binge eating all weekend. Day 1 was pretty easy.

	I skipped out on bags because I just needed a day to decompress.

	6/19

	Feeling pretty beat from the lack of food but powering through. Had to forfeit our softball game since we didn’t have enough but still scrimmaged even though I had zero interest in staying.

	Made it to hour 47 before I made some food, keto broccoli and cheese casserole.

	6/20 - Wed

	Bored at work, making changes to websites that I don’t give a fuck about. 

	Realizing today that I might have gotten ghosted by both of my past two interviewees.. so shitty considering how well I felt that they both went.

	Got a nice thank you card from Dad and an unnecessary check for $100. He seems very appreciative of the gift, he even said it was the best gift he’s ever received. Good job Mom!

	Won 2 of 3 volleyball games.

	Watched the movie carpool for the first time in like 15 years, Katie and I used to love that movie. I can still quote it.

	6/21

	Team putting to the Saints game tonight. I’m coincidentally driving a carpool.

	I drove Evan and Dan and we pregamed a bit at the Bulldog. 

	By the time we got here in the second the Saints were already down 9-0.. I was feeling pretty awkward since everyone was snap chatting and I don’t really know them all that well so I decided to go explore the stadium since I hadn’t been to CHS field yet. Walked around for an inning or two before going back to my seat.. the score was now 11-0. The game was a blowout to say the least so we decided to leave early.

	6/22 - Friday

	WFH day. Lacey had to take the car in to get our windshield wiper fixed and get an oil change. I grabbed some coffee at Maeve’s and worked a little.

	I went to the DMV to register the canoe but was turned away because they needed “physical copies” with a “live signature”. I was not happy. So I went home, emailed StephenSquared to see if he’d be willing to sign again since we wanted to get on the water ASAP. Luckily he worked downtown so we met up with him at Caribou in US Bank and we’re able to get to the DMV before they closed.

	Canoe registered, finally.

	We spent all day running around so by the time we got home we didn’t really feel like putting the effort into canoing. We went to Theodore Wirth Park instead and did some fishing off the public dock. Nothing for me but L caught her first “large” mouth bass and even held it.

	6/23

	Woke up early and packed up the canoe. Arrived at the northern most part of Lake of the Isles and boarded. The morning was sunny and calm. We paddled around the isles a bit and then over to Calhoun (Bde Maka Ska). 

	There was some sort of sailboat race going on so we maneuvered around them and lazily paddled to the beach on the south side of the lake to take a dip. We intercepted some diving loons along the way. 

	After a somewhat lengthy trek to the beach we turned around and madeway back to the docking location. By the time we got there we were both exhausted. Loaded up pretty successfully and went to Bachmans to pick up a gift for Ryan’s housewarming party and a little something for Anna’s bday before making it home to nap.

	In the mid afternoon we went to the housewarming party which was pretty fun. The usual suspects were there. Played kubb, grilled some meats, had some drinks. 

	We learned that Brett had been drinking again and received a felonious DUI for evading a police officer..

	6/24

	Woke up to find I was kicked out of keto somehow so I said fuck it and we went to get some greasy food and bloodies at Spring Street. 

	Almost obligatory post Spring Street nap.

	We started the series Six Feet Under and ordered Dominoes.

	6/25

	Late bags game. I biked to uptown prior to play some pinball at Tilt. Almost beat my high score in Monster Bash.

	Lost all 3 games but they were all close.

	6/26

	Found out Liz put in her two weeks notice.. apparently I’m moving back to the design team primarily. Still not sure how hyped I am on that. Found out Brett was drinking and driving again last night and lying about it.. he needs to get into treatment ASAP.

	Got a HH at Moose before softball with L, Ryan, Dane, Tom, and Avery.

	We won our game against Knight Cap, I had a homerun.

	6/27 - Wed

	Trying to figure out my tax shit today, I need to send a response to the IRS by the 5th. Such a bummer, 11k is so much money.

	6/28

	Lost vb to the team tied with us for second. We all played like shit so it was a tough loss. 

	Watched some six feet under and did laundry after. Still not really digging the series too much but hoping it’ll get better.

	6/29

	Sent over my tax materials to the CPA today, hoping for a miracle. Fingers crossed.

	Supposed to be 90+ degrees and humid today, woof.

	Softball tonight followed by some fishing. Got skunked at the stone arch spot.

	2run hr to secure the win.

	6/30 - Friday

	100 degree day. Team offsite at Moose for a couple cocktails and discussion over design versioning. Looked in the app “Abstract” which functions a lot like git.

	Got some HH food and drinks with L at Mac’s after trying to get wings at Ray Jays. It was packed and hot as balls in there.

	Bought some Ron Diaz on a whim (remembering the good old days). 

	6/31 - Sat

	Another hot day. Met Ryan at Extreme Noise to browse the flea market while Lacey read at Spyhouse. Ended leaving without making any purchases, chalked that up as a win.

	A little pinball at Morts, talked about Brett. 

	Quick stop at Uptown Tavern for a drink and then decided to get all you can eat sushi at Kyoto. Ate our faces off and then back to our place.

	L and I cleaned up the place a bit and then the three of us met up with Dustin, Camille, and Korman at Elsie’s for a couple games. I lost a close second game to Ryan.

	Next stop Dangerous Man for some PB Porter, a extra dirty martini at the peacock lounge, one at 331, a couple more at Jimmies, and a night cap at Grumpy’s NE. 

	We were all starving so we stopped for some gross drunk food at SA and binge ate until we passed out. Ryan crashed on the couch.

	Busy day!

<h3>JULY 2018</h3>
	=========

	July 1 - Sun

	Woke up to pouring rain. L wanted a new book so we went to Open Book on Washington and got some Vietnamese coffee and shopped around.

	Decided to get a Groupon for the Crooked Pint since we’d never been there before and we’re pleasantly surprised. Good beers on tap, decent atmosphere with the World Cup playing on every screen, and the food was decent. Got totchos and a French dip.

	The day cleared up and the evening was actually pretty nice and sunny. We bought another hammock, supposedly a double, but it’s still too small for us both.

	Hung out in Boom Island, met up with Soda/Ryan and Korman and did a little fishing. No bites and Ryan lost my buzzbait, oh well.

	July 2 - Mon

	Tilt and bags. Matt and I played Danko’s team, he’s now GM of Herk apparently. We won all 3. Ryan and Anna met us there and we all went to Moto-I rooftop for some drinks and food to enjoy the night.
	Hot sake, edamame, and miso. 

	July 3 - Tues

	WFH, met with a couple guys for coffee from Ameriprise about a possible digital technologist position. The job sounded pretty boring but the pay would maybe make it worth it. Waiting to hear if hey want me to come back for a formal interview. 

	Bussed home and grabbed some sushi from Lunds on the way. Had to get some work done after lunch so went to spyhouse and finished up some things.

	The night turned out to be really nice so I drove over to Nicollet Island to try to do some fishing. Found a couple nice spots but no fish and I lost another lure.

	July 4 

	Slow start to a rainy morning. Didn’t sleep too well the night before. Got some ingredients for coffee cocktails and some mini muffins and met up with a couple people at Ryan’s. Played some ping pong and shot the shit a bit.

	Appetizers and drinks at Howe’s. 

	Taco Bell nightcap after a few more beers at Ryan’s.

	July 5

	Had to work during the day, can’t wait to get off so we can get to Sibley.

	Left work a bit early, packed up the canoe and hit the road. Was a bit nerve wracking to get on the highway with that beast on top but I think we’re pretty much pros at securing it now.

	Got to the site after stopping at A&W for some dinner (order was wrong of course) and Pete’s Surplus for some bait. We were located at the group primitive site - P3. It was pretty big and we all had plenty of space to spread out. Put up the tent quick and after a short hike we found that the canoe launch on A21 was close by so we decided to hit the water.

	The night was perfect and the water was glass. We threw out a couple of bobbers and before long got some bites. We caught about 5 bullheads before heading in to meet up with the rest of the crew.

	Had a fire and all crashed early.

	July 6 - Fri

	Woke up early made coffee and hit the dock for some morning fishing. Again only bullheads. At least Vera got to meet her first fish.

	When everyone woke up we made way to the beach. It was pretty windy so we didn’t really get much swimming in. Tried playing some volleyball with not much success. Korman and I fished, also no success. Ryan passed out in the fetal position on the beach.

	Zorbaz for a pizza dinner (chemical pie). Bbq chicken and a peanut butter pepperoni with some nachos and margs. Got a sense that Ryan and Anna weren’t fans. Lacey “got” a sweatshirt since she about froze to death in the tent the night before.. I slept like a baby.

	Another fire and some s’mores.

	July 7 - Sat

	Slept in a bit. L and I went down to the beach while the others went on a hike to Mt. Tom (we did the hike last year so we weren’t overly interested in joining). It was pretty windy by the time we got down there so we decided to check out the shop, we found a kite shaped like a bat and decided to buy it; we called him Guiseppe. We walked over to the nearby baseball field and gave our best efforts to fly it but weren’t super successful. 

	Around the time we gave up the rest of the crew showed up we all blew up our tubes and waded out to tie up to a buouy. 

	July 8 - Sun

	Packed up early and drove to Spicer for some brunch. Johnny ONeils wasn’t open so we got coffee at the diner nearby and walked down to the water at Green Lake. Vera went for a swim.

	Split some bloodies and eggs Benedict before parting ways with Ryan and Anna.

	I got pull d over on the way home, the rope from our canoe had come undone and was flapping behind the car. Luckily I didn’t get a ticket for anything.

	July 9

	Biked to uptown and won all three bags games.

	July 10

	Got murdered in softball by the Clobber Monkeys and got called snowflakes by our ump who unanimously sucked.

	July 11

	Volleyball in 100 degree heat. Won all three. So sweaty. Detour on the way home brought us through Whittier so we decided to get some pho from Quang. 

	July 12

	Another humid day. Confirmed an interview at Ameriprise on Tuesday at 9am. 2.5 hours long, blah. I hope it goes well. 50/hr would be really nice.

	Softball got rained out so L and I went to Surdyks for some drinks. I played rocket league with David and drank a 6 pack of Day Trippers.

	July 13

	Got 3 shoutouts at our monthly company meeting.

	July 14

	Farmers market with L, got some spring rolls and she got some pickling cucumbers.

	Met up with Dustin and Camille at Bauhaus for the 4 year brewery anniversary party. Ry and Anna met up with V. Quick stop at Fairstate.

	Lacey and I had to leave to go to Woody and Amy’s for a bbq, stopped for some beers and apps to bring.

	Made it to west St. Paul, it was just the two of them. Got the house tour, sat around and talked, wasn’t too bad. Played some ping pong with Woody. Girard showed up and we grilled up some burgers.

	Left to meet back up with DC and David and Olivia at Shamrocks. Got some onion rings and later went to Ogaras. We sat on the patio for a bit and decided to head to Taco Bell where we sat in the drive through for a good 30 minutes and listened to MTB; Minus the bear highly defined pirates still an all time favorite.

	July 15 - Sun

	Disc golf with Dustin, David, and Olivia in Roseville at Acorn Park. L went to a movie.

	I threw my disc in the marsh on my first throw, luckily there were some kids there hustling discs so one went in to get it. I ended up buying a new disc from them to avoid losing Lacey’s. Support local business..

	The rest of the course was really nice/fun/challenging. Would definitely play it again.

	July 16

	Woke up with pink eye so worked from home. Had to cancel my interview at Ameriprise. 

	Got some eye drops from the Minute Clinic and did some grocery shopping while I waited. Picked up fried chicken for dinner.

	July 17

	Softball; a close win over the pounders.

	July 18

	Volleyball playoffs began. We snuck by to win 2-1 after losing our first game and nearly winning the second. Moving in the the semi finals.

	July 19

	So tired after work, had to power nap.

	May have been the least fun I’ve ever had playing softball. Started off short players and I think in the first inning we strung together maybe one hit. The constant annoying drizzle didn’t help. Multiple pathetic errors later by our team we got 20 run ruled after a short 3 innings. Fun.

	July 20

	This week has been hellishly busy at work with Evan being out. I feel like I’ve been rushing to get projects out the door since 9am Monday so I’m pretty exhausted and stressed out. So happy it’s Friday. 

	Been drinking a lot again, this stress really gets to me.

	Rescheduled my Ameriprise interview to Tuesday.

	Have two presentations this afternoon, needless to say I’m not looking forward to them so I really can’t wait to just get home and unwind after this week.

	Had a great wireframe presentation with Tart Optical and then got off at 4. Came home and played rocket league and had some drinks. Lacey went to a movie and got Giordanos deep dish on the way back; it wasn’t as good as I remembered.

	We tried to watch Junun but it was pretty boring so we just watched naked and afraid.. then both games all night.

	July 21 Sat

	Malibu Beach Party volleyball tournament at Memory Lanes.

	The pool play of the tournament didn’t start until 4 so we grabbed some lunch with the team at the Hideaway Burger Bar on St Anthony. Got a super sloppy bbq burger with an onion ring but it was pretty damn good. 

	Met up at Memory during the upper games before us and thought we were that, the other teams looked so good.

	We finished pool play around 9 with a record of 5-3. 4th of 7.

	Games were running late but the bracket was made and we played our first game at 9:45. Won our first two and immediately played the next game again the team that beat us both games in pool play. They beat us game one but we brought our A game for game two and pulled off the win. 
	Game three maybe have been one of the best games we’ve played as a team, we won and advanced to the championship against the team of 4.

	Finally after waiting around for another hour it was time to hit the sand. It was 1-1 going into the third and final game. We were all playing really well.. tied it up at 14 but unfortunately lost 16-14 to take second place.

	Overall great day with great company. We won a $50 gift card and $150 cash.


	July 22

	Lacey and I must have really wore ourselves out, we both slept until 3!

	Decided to get some food. Landed on Nuevo de Mariachi on eat street. We’ve always really liked the atmosphere of that place. We walked in and a mariachi band was playing, brought us back to Mexico. I ordered(and ate) a giant burrito.

	Stopped at Tilt for some pinball, had a AFM 7 billion but nothing else very notable.

	Evel Kenieval documentary and massage Sunday with L’s new slippery purchase.

	July 23 - Mon

	Found out I don’t have to wear a suit to my interview tomorrow so that’s good news, I would have felt so out of place to be over dressed. Plus I got an awful haircut this weekend so add that to the list.

	Ate so shitty this last week, I blame it on my workload and interview stress. I need to get back into my routine. I hope I get this job so I can get my Y membership back.

	Matt and I won all three bags games in the league playoffs to advance to the tournament this Saturday; first place wins $1000!

	July 24

	Woke up at 5 to start prepping for my interview. 

	Met with Billy Whited in the Ameriprise lobby right around 9 and he took me up to my interview room which was a stuffy little office space where I met a couple people from the design end who I presented my portfolio pieces to. I feel like that portion went really well so I was feeling pretty good about things at that point. Next up was another 45 min interview, behavioral assessment. I also thought this one went decently, I met with a product owner and another digital technologist who I’d be working with. It was a little less structured and more informative.

	Next up, the coding challenge. By this time I was a bit drained.. Billy and another technologist came in and presented me with the “challenge” which was a small navigation with some icons. I initially thought it was no big deal until I realized that they’d be watching me as I coded and on top of that I found that the icons were part of an icon font and not .pngs. 

	I immediately became flustered and couldn’t really regain my train of thought, they had to basically walk me through it and it went pretty poorly.. embarrassing. I was happy to be done and get out of there. 

	Long story short, I had high hopes for 100k job but crashed and burned. Better luck next time I guess.

	July 25 - Wed 

	Received a message from Courtney my recruiter today that said she had some feedback from Ameriprise regarding my interview so I gave her a call back. She asked how it went and I told her it went well up until the coding challenge. At this point I had convinced myself that I blew it, but she in return told me that they made me an offer which I was super surprised to hear. I told her I needed a couple of days to think it over.

	I talked to Dad and Lacey about it and really, as much as I do like the comfortability of R55, the money is just too good to pass up. 

	Had volleyball playoffs. We all played like shit. We did however win the first matches to advance to the championship but no one really showed up to play and we ended up losing and not advancing to the tournament of champions.

	Lacey and I got McDonald’s to drown our sorrows.

	7/26

	Woke up early and went for a jog to clear my head and attempt to formulate my resignation.

	A few thoughts I've had over the past weeks/months:

	Feeling bored but excited to learn more
	Uncomfortable

	Need more work/challenging work
	Raise

	Need daily tasks

	Unfulfilled

	Work from home

	Need review

	Trying to grow

	At a stand still

	Curious to learn

	Who to report to, strattling both teams
	Unsure of responsibilities 

	Evan and Nelson were busy when I got in so the inevitable was delayed. I finally got ahold of them and they were both really understanding about it. Evan said Angelina was trying to get him to move over to US Bank also but he wanted to put in at least a year at r55 first. They understood that I couldn’t turn down that kind of money, they asked for rocket to match it, but as was expected they couldn’t. 

	I have a call with my recruiter soon to accept the position.. what a crazy week.

	Talked to Josh over at Apex and he congratulated me on the offer and mentioned that the digital technologist position has been historically challenging to fill and that Ameriprise has high standards; apparently they’ve passed on 5 before me.

	He answered all my questions that I had had about the position and I accepted.. I start 8/13.

	Met up with a couple dudes from the softball team at moose to hand off the bat bag and have a few, I fucked up my wrist a couple weeks back so decided to sit that one out. Lacey met me there for a few before we went home and made a bacon wrapped meatloaf and watched Ali G.

	7/27

	Had a good evening with Lacey. Took a nap after work and was super tired from the week but felt a bit better after I woke up so we decided to go grab a few beers at Dangerous Man and get her bike repaired. We were getting a bit hungry and just realized there was a New Mexican spot over by the Highlight Center so we walked over and got a few tacos and a couple drinks. I also got some oysters.

	Ryan invited us over since he was home with Vera; Anna was out of town. Lacey decided to go home and play Zelda but I took a lyft over. Played some ping pong, I finally one one.

	Korman, Sean, and Matt stopped over. Shot the shit and I caught a ride back to NE with them all for a night cap at Spring Street.

	Terry Kolsch > Scary Kolsch

	7/28

	Woke up pretty hungover at 10:30.. had a bags tourney starting at 11 so rushed to get ready.

	Lacey drove us to the Herk and parked in front of the old place on Garfield (after seeing a car accident on lyn/lake). We won our first game pretty easily so we hopped across the street and got brunch at Muddy Waters; eggs Benedict. Ryan met us there.

	Next game was at 1, we won that one also but narrowly. Another 2 hour wait and then got crushed, only to lose again in the losers bracket. We choked.

	Matt owed me toppers so we got pizza and met up at my place to eat. Ryan and Korman came by and we had some beers and listened to music inside since it started to downpour. Ryan smoked too much weed and proceeded to insist he could bike home but I ordered him a Lyft instead.

	7/29

	Found out gpa Robson is going to be moved to hospice tomorrow.. I’m trying to make it down there with Dad and Linda. I think it’s mean a lot to him. 

	Lacey and I went for a walk and hammocked in BF Nelson for a bit and I took a little snooze. 

	Pretty much napped on and off all day.

	Took care of the xnode binding.

	She made some bomb Chinese food for dinner and we watched Top Chef.

	7/30
	x2

	Spent the night doing laundry and playing RL. Dad said the grandpa is weak and in pain and doesn’t want any visitors. Him and Linda are still going on Friday but might mean that I’ll be staying.

	Again trying to convince myself that drinking is killing me. It’s so stupid how much I’d rather live a sober lifestyle but always keep coming back. Day two, better than none. 

	Fasted today, trying to kickstart ketosis again. 

	7/31
	x3

	Back on the fasting/sober/keto train. Went for a morning jog before work, since not really running this month I’ve only lost about 10 seconds from my prior pace so not too bad.

	While running over the Plymouth bridge this morning I was thinking about grandpa and how happy he always seemed when he was around Katie and I. I could see the sun shining through the railing and the glimmer of it off the river in the corner of my eye and I hoped that he experienced the same morning sun and had a moment of solace.

<h3>AUGUST 2018</h3>

	8/1 - Wed

	Just got word that grandpa passed today at 4pm central time. At least he’s not in pain anymore. I feel so bad for Dad right now.. he regrets not being there to see him one last time to say goodbye, and thanks.

	I got drunk and tried to numb my thoughts like I’m accustomed to doing.

	I wish I knew how to feel. I’m so inexperienced with death that it’s almost unhealthy.

	The sadness came in waves, tears were shed. I feel so bad for my dad mostly, but I’m happy he was able to reconnect with grandpa over the past few years. 

	8/2

	Worked remote. I drove over to Cafetto for some new scenery. Worked some there, played a little pinball. I was expected to be in Edina to sign some papers at Apex at 3 so I had some time to kill.

	Ended up going to the Southdale Mall to do some clothes shopping for Ameriprise. Found a bunch of good stuff at JCrew, a couple new pairs of shoes, and some cologne samples from Sephora. So far I think I like the Polo Red the best.

	8/3 - Friday

	Woke up early and decided to start work early at Spyhouse. The office had been pretty loud the past few days and I had two full site designs due by the time I was to leave Rocket. Got a good portion of the EcoWater design done by roughly noon so I headed home and Lacey and I packed up the car and made our way towards Tipsinaw for a weekend camping trip with Dustin and Camille.

	Rain was in the forecast all weekend so we packed accordingly. We finally made it after terrible traffic and a stock at KFC in St Cloud (we got like 5 extra strips!). It was overcast but no rain yet so we hurried and set up the tent. It started sprinkling towards the latter half of our setup so we jimmy rigged a tarp over the front portion to keep our stuff dry and went to check out the town of Elbow Lake.

	We got a few supplies and then landed at the only bar in town, the Knotty Pine, got some onion rings and some beers and headed back to meet D&C.

	Sat at a fire with Camille’s friends (Ross and Megan’s) and hit the hay a bit early.

	8/4

	Overcast and cool all morning but no rain. Stopped at the camp shop for some crawlers and fished all morning. Mostly just set up bobbers but we were getting bites all morning. I lost a huge fish due to a snapped line but about 30 min later I caught the same fish along with my tackle! It was by far my PB large mouth. Lacey caught a giant largemouth too along with a few small ones. Overall successful fishing day.

	We went to town around 4 to get a few drinks and find a spot for the Flekkenfest parade. Typical small town parade complete with Shriners, tractors, a candy toss, and dudes with trucks.

	Tried to start a fire but the wood we got was super wet so went back over to the other spot after grilling up some brats. 

	“Smears Brosnin”

	8/5

	Woke up early and fished with Dustin. Not as much luck as the morning before but the sunrise was nice and the lake was calm. Caught a couple sunnies and some smaller bass.

	Packed up everything and met up at the Knotty Pine once more for lunch. I had a lackluster fish and chips and Lacey got a hockey puck of a burger..

	Stopped at Broadway Pizza on our way back in because we were both craving pizza. Had a few at the bar and went home to watch Ancient Aliens.

	Called Home to see how mom and Dad are doing after the news. They seem to be doing well but of course there’s drama on the Robson side.. apparently uncle Paul sent Lois a nasty text and is being a little drama queen. Fuck em.

	The pizza was terrible.

	8/6 

	Offboarding at work, trying to get everything in order so I can reset my computer. Finished up my last big project, EcoWater, so now I’m just biding my time.

	8/7

	Woke up and went for a 5k run while listening to a new podcast, Teacher’s Lounge.

	Took another personality test today to once again confirm that I’m an INFJ. Less than 1% of the population is INFJ so that’s pretty crazy.

	Got off work and bought some God’s Unchained packs.. what a super nerdy new (and expensive) hobby. 

	L got home and wanted to happy hour and use our new drink passport that Anna gave us. We biked over to Hai Hai, the old Duece Duece, and got a couple gin/ginger cocktails and a couple spring rolls. The patio was really nice, it felt tropical. Quite to contrary to the last time I was in that place sitting on sniffers row with Lacey, Chuck, and Casey watching sad strippers make a living.

	8/8

	Woke up and went for a jog and listened to Teacher’s Lounge.

	I have my exit interview today. It went well, I discussed not loving the open floor plan but said I was happy overall with my time there.

	8/9

	Last day at r55. The morning was spent wiping my computer and reinstalling the osx. This was taking forever so I ran to the post office to send out some things. When I got back I turned in my keys and installed some software. I really didn’t have anything to do so I took off at 1 to get lunch with Lacey at Moose. French exit on the last day.

	Lacey and I had a few drinks and took a nap. I met up with Evan, Ellen, and Angelina at Moose again for a happy hour and a farewell.

	8/10

	L and I packed up for our trip to Mora and got on the road around 11. We made it there in about an hour or so, got some drinks, groceries, and stopped at a cool little pizza shop (Emma’s Pizza) for a bite while the cabin was being cleaned. We ordered the “dually” which was two thin crust pizzas with cheese in the middle and toppings on top. It was delicious.

	Finally around 2 we got to Devil’s Lake and unpacked. We immediately put on swimsuits and I threw some lines in the water. Literally after two minutes I caught the first largemouth of the trip. 

	Sat in the tube, grilled some burgers and brats, snacked on Cheetos, made a fire. Caught a few more fish; a nice sized northern and our first bowfin.

	Great night. Can’t wait to have a cabin of our own.

	8/11

	Slept in a little, made some Maxwell House, and started fishing. Mostly smaller stuff all day but caught a nice sized blue gill that I strung up and eventually cleaned. Lacey hammocked and read most of the day. We took out the “Mighty Toon” electric pontoon in he afternoon and anchored up so we could float on the tube.

	A lot of fireball later we came in and started thinking about dinner. Lacey took a power nap in the hammock and I just fished.

	Leftover grillables and Meet the Fockers.

	8/12

	Left “Peace of Pine” at 11 after our morning routine of coffee by the water.

	Listened to 3EB and Osker on the way home.

	Stopped at Blainesbrook on the way for a snack and some pinball. I sucked it up but at least I got to play LOTR.

	Took a midday nap. We decided on pho, Lacey drove to Pho 79. Mine was pretty weak sauce but the egg rolls were decent.

	8/13

	Day 1 at Ameriprise. I met Spencer in the lobby and we walked and talked while he grabbed some coffee. We met another contractor and he lead us up to get our badges and showed us around the floor. I didn’t have a computer for a few hours so did a whole lot of nothing.

	Finally got my computer but then spent most of my day installing programs and trying to get access to others. All in all not a very productive day but such is life when you’re in corporate. Going to have to get used to the glacial speed things move at once again.

	Renewed the gym membership.

	Ate leftover pizza and watched a documentary about medical devices - “Bleeding Edge”

	8/14

	Day 2 Ameriprise. Got up early and ran to the Y. Did some lifting and explored the facility a bit. Back up to 120lbs so I need to stop eating/drinking like shit and get back under 200. Hoping that the new job, despite it’s monotony, will provide the structure I need to focus on my health more.

	8/15

	Tagged along to a Saints game with my new team. Got there after a good 30 minutes trying to park. Temps were in the 80’s so it was a sweaty one. Not many people were very interested in the game so we all walked over to the bulldog for a couple drinks.

	//Satchel (Denim repair)
	-Science and kindness

	Won our volleyball games with 5.

	“How do I get one of them fudge pumps?” - Lacey at McDonalds

	8/16

	Pretty productive day gathering some much needed context about the projects I’ll be working on.

	Took a gym break in the afternoon and was out of work by 4. Really love having the flexibility again and not having to feel like the need to justify every absence. It’s nice not feeling like you’re being babysat by Steven..

	Made a keto dinner; chicken and broccoli along with some cauliflower bites.

	8/17

	Today marks one full year of journaling. I feel like it’s helped me to clear my head a bit even though my entries aren’t anything too elaborate. 

	Pretty slack day today, going to gym it this afternoon. 

	Talked to Dad today. He mentioned that there was still family drama going on that he’s staying out of. I guess Lois is having an estate sale to sell all their belongings and listed the house since she can’t afford it on her own. She’ll be getting an apartment alone. She also found out she has skin cancer so it’s been a tough month for her.

	Grandpa didn’t have a funeral; he didn’t want a service. He was just cremated and his ashes were sent to Linda.

	David was in town to hang out with Olivia this weekend, we turned down an invite to a whiskey bar due to the volleyball tournament the following day. 

	8/18

	Tournament of Champions day. First game of the pool play was at 10:40, won both. Then split, lost both, and split; ended up getting 3rd of 5 in pool. Won our first bracketed game and advanced to the finals. We were all pretty tired, played ok but ended up losing to our Wednesday-night-refs team. They were good, they played better than us. We got 2nd for the third time this year and won $120.

	Totally dead after the tournament so we just went home and crashed. I managed to stay keto throughout the day.

	8/19

	Woke up and could hardly move, my body was so sore. Totally regretting working out hard on Friday. I meal prepped some scrambled eggs and ham for the week, Lacey went to the store to get hollandaise.

	We decided to go to the Y to sit in the hottub since we were so sore so we bussed downtown and took a dip. 

	Quick trip to the depot to pick up Pedro the Lion tickets for Wednesday.

	I’m now on the green line with a vodka/Red Bull on my way to meet up with Ryan, Brett, and Anna at the Xcel to see Smashing Pumpkins. Really not a fan of arena shows so have moderate expectations.

	8/20

	Pretty typical Monday. Work, gym, dinner, and to bed early.

	Starting my Keto Gains 5x5 routine today. Weights today and HIIT tomorrow.

	Still pretty bored at work, kind of have an idea of what I’ll be working on but not having a PM is kind of odd. It sounds like some of the design work won’t really need to happen for another month?

	8/21

	L and I woke up early and biked to the Y. I did some kettlebells and swam a bit. Soaked in the hottub too which feels awesome before going to work. Got in at 8:15.

	Jimmy Johns lunch with Lacey at IDS by the fountain. It’s nice to be able to meet for lunch again.

	8/22

	8/23

	Biked in but wasn’t feeling well so worked from home in the afternoon.

	8/24

	Felt like shit and had a terrible cough so I stayed home. Didn’t get much work done, slept most of the day. Got gross and ordered Pizza Hut to try and make myself feel better, it was late, cold, and burnt.. what did I expect really? Pigged out on that and took a nap.

	8/25

	2’s volleyball tournament is Otsego.
	Woke up sick as shit at 7:30. It was cool and overcast; still wet from the nights rain. Matt picked me up, stopped for gas and a coffee, and drove out to Boondox Bar. The complex was pretty huge, 5 courts all together.

	We arrived and realized quickly that we were way out of our league just by the look of the other teams.

	Our first game was definitely a humbling experience. Even though Matt and I played well (so I thought) we got crushed 21-5. Second game was worse, 21-2. We actually won our third game against the team who lost every game in the tournament. Lost our last 3 pool play games and they made the bracket. We played second in the losers bracket.. we started off strong but we both ran out of steam and that was the end of it. We got 2nd(to last) in yet another tournament.

	8/26
	X1

	Full day of recovery, laziness, and cleaning. Finally organized all my photos that have been on my desktop for months.

	Lacey and I finally watched A Quiet Place and it fucking ruled. So captivating for as little amount of dialogue there was.

	8/27
	X2

	Still not feeling awesome but went to work anyways. The three projects that I’m on are all starting to ramp up simultaneously and it’s stressing me out; a lot of moving pieces and I pretty much have to manage my own time with not a ton of direction.

	Talked to my CPA today and it sounds like I maybe have gotten my fine down to 5k. Still not fun but a heckofa lot better than 11k. Fuck. Could have been a pinball machine.

	Crazy brain fog but made it to the gym at least. L and I had an early dinner and watched “Summer of 84”.

	8/28
	X3

	Been so bad about journaling the past few days but my weekend/week has been crazy.

	Had a productive day at work, sent some designs out for review so feeling a little less stressed.

	Double header tonight at 8. Won our first game and lost our second by 1 in the bottom of the 7th by a play at home. Close games.

	8/29

	So hard to get out of bed today so I stayed in bed for an extra half hour to cuddle with Huey. I miss biking into downtown, it’s so nice taking the 3rd street bridge on a brisk sunny morning and seeing the city scape as you come in.

	Early vb games tonight, won 2 lost 1. We didn’t really seem all there.

	L and I started watching Afflicted on Netflix.

	8/30

	Had a delicious sushi bowl from Takatsu in the skyway for lunch, L got the Tori Undon and didn’t love it.. too much seaweed.

	We walked around and sat in the park for some sun.

<h3>SEPTEMBER 2018</h3>

	9/1 - Fri

	Worked from home and we took off around 3 for Big Stone to meet up with Mom and Dad. We got in around 6:30 or so after stopping at the bait shop and of course Casey’s for a pizza.

	Mom fried up some burgers and we just sat around and had a few drinks.

	Threw a few lines out with no luck.

	We found some old VHS tapes so we started Emperor’s New Groove. 

	9/2

	Mom made some breakfast while I tried to do some fishing off the dock, again no luck. Way too many weeds.  

	Early afternoon we headed over to Schmidt’s Landing to get our boat rental.. Mom and Dad were being super weird about signing the rental agreement and Dad refused to sign it altogether so Mom had to. I got stuck being the captain again since no one else felt comfortable. 

	The boat was a little 16’ fishing boat, just big enough for the 4 of us. We got some intel from the guy helping us so we made way to the hot spots to hopefully get some walleyes. The weather was perfect, not too hot but the sun was warm and we had a nice cool breeze. There were a lot of boats out but we weren’t seeing much action.

	5 hours had passed with not even a bite but finally Mom had something on her line.. she got it close to the boat but we weren’t able to land it.. a giant pike, easily the biggest I’ve seen; probably 5-6lbs. 

	So much for the fish fry, but at least we got out in the water. 

	We grilled up some brats. Dad insisted on keeping the lights off on the deck and I couldn’t see shit, so I was annoyed. He always has to have his way.

	Watched Grumpier Old Men (or as Dad thought it was called Dirty Old Man).

	9/3

	Cleaned up the cabin and hit the road. Another Big Stone trip come and gone, it didn’t really even feel like a vacation, it went so fast. 

	I really hope Mom and Dad get a lake cabin at some point, I love spending time on the water. 

	Found out Dad has been taking blood pressure meds and fainted a couple weeks back and Mom had to call an ambulance. They didn’t have to take him in but nonetheless, scary. I wish he’d look out for himself.

	9/4

	Back to work today, really not feeling it. 

	Softball got rained out so we ate leftover pizza and started watching season 2 of Ozark.

	9/5

	Finally paid off my 11% interest loan from Sallie Mae. Fuck student loans.

	Gloomy bike ride in.

	Got lunch with Lacey at Takatsu again, the sushi bowls are just too good. Really should have worked out though. 

	Got a bottle of whiskey on my way home :/ Bought the rocket pass for RL and played that for a couple hours before volleyball.

	Woody, Amy, and Ashley were all out so we had Ryan and Anna sub. Did not go so well, we lost all three games.

	9/6

	Ugh really dreading work this week. Not so much my job but moreso the fact that I have to work in general. 

	Took a half day tomorrow so Lacey and I can head back to Iowa to see her parents and go to their county fair.

	9/7

	Meetings got cancelled so just “worked” from home. Got packed up and got on the road around noon. As we were heading south on 35 I realized that I completely forgot to pack shoes and only had my flip flops. 

	We decided to make a pit stop at the mall of America to get me some new vans, luckily I was in need anyways. Walked by Wahlburgers so decided to check it out and get lunch. Had a couple beers, burgers, and apps. We both gave it a 3.5/5. It was good but the burgers were under seasoned. The onion rings were bomb though.

	Also stopped at the Pepper Palace, the hot sauce store to sample some sauces. We walked in and there was a guy who clearly was coming down from eating something far too hot for him, turns out it was “The End” extract which is 3x hotter than a reaper.. Decided to save that for another day. I did however go straight for the reaper sauces. Good but not overly hot. Also tried a horseradish called “Nasal Napalm” and naturally I bought it. Along with the reaper/mustard sauce.

	Finally made it to Shaller around 7 or so and we all decided to go get BBQ at the Smokin’ Hereford, our favorite restaurant in Storm Lake. I got a silo of beer (64oz served in a mason jar), the catfish bites, and some stuffed mushrooms.. Not the greatest, will be sticking with the BBQ from now on.

	9/8

	Up early due to some noisey ass dogs, forgot to put in my ear plugs.

	We all got ready and headed to Kaitlin’s to pick her up at 9, but as expected she wasn’t ready so we stopped at Grand Central for some coffee. 

	Finally picked her up and we made way to Spencer which was about a 45 minute drive. The weather was perfect, sunny but not too hot.

	Got into the fair and we all immediately b-lined to the food carts. Within probably a half hour between the 5 of us we got poutine (the gravy was deliciously peppery), crab fritters (the best thing I had all day), cheese curds (nowhere near Foxy Fallafel’s), cream cheese stuffed pickles (we went back for seconds and thirds), a giant root beer (mug included), some beef satay (I didn’t try but it smelled phenomenal), and a few drinks (a lemonade for L and a smoothie for K). Gluttony at it’s finest.

	From then on the next few hours were a bit noneventful, we walked the grounds which were mostly filled with tractors and livestock, nothing too exciting for a city slicker like me. We perused the trade booths, found some free dip and cheese samples, and I actually found some hot sauces I’ve been meaning to try (Blair’s Mega Death and Mad Dog 357). 

	We ended our Clay County Fair journey by looking at some poorly baked goods, gourd art, watching a comedian talk about his beer gut, and snacking a bit more.. had to get my jurassic corn dog.

	On the way back I tried the Mad Dog and it didn’t hit me immediately so I offered a tiny bit to Lacey, she tried it and it wrecked her world; immediately regret and tears. It gave me some crazy heartburn and a terrible stomach ache for like 10 minutes too, but the taste was worth it.

	Made a stop to get some liquor on the way back in, and cheesy olive dip at Hy-Vee. Lori and Mark smoked up some ribeyes and burgers for us on their new Traeger, so good even though I definitely didn’t need more food.

	Watched and episode of Ozark and passed out 😵 

	9/9

	Slept like a baby with my earplugs in. Got up before everyone else so we decided to pack up and hit the road so we could get home at a decent time. They gifted us their old smoker so we packed that up as well.

	We all met at Grand Central again for some coffees and lunch before we took off, L and I split a Philly cheesesteak sandwich; again definitely not hungry but it was good.

	Overcast day, wasn’t too thrilled about being on the road but we threw on the Teacher’s Lounge podcast which kept us entertained. Stopped halfway for some Casey’s pizza (and Wendy’s?), I honestly don’t know why because the thought of food disgusted me but the thought of Casey’s prevailed.

	9/10

	Wasn’t excited about being back at work but what else is new. Typical grind, gym, home. 

	9/11

	SSDD.

	Softball double header at 6/7, won both by 10+. Don’t think I’m going to play the second fall season since our league might get moved to either Bryn Mawr or Bossen and I think I just want a break anyways. Calling it quits on being “coach” for a while since the commitment from most just wasn’t really there this year which made it hard to care.

	Talked to Brett a bit, sounds like he’s doing well since getting out of treatment. He’s being promoted to full time at Whole Food working in produce. He’s also starting taking some online computer science classes, happy for him. Hah, also learned that Ryan has a squirrel problem at the new house.. they’ve chewed their way into his attic.

	Struggling with drinking again. I brought “wackdonalds”, as Ryan likes to call it, to the game and polished off the rum we bought in Storm Lake. Decided that was the last of it so I would start a new after the games, but of course my dumb brain lead me to the liquor store on my way home and I had another .375 of whiskey before bed. Fuck.

	9/12
	x1

	Woke up hungover like an idiot. Luckily I was wfh since I had a dentist appt at 9, I really felt little motivation to do much of anything. Got home from the dentist (no cavities!) and took a nap. Woke up feeling a little better, had some lunch, started laundry, and went to get my haircut at the Barber Sharp. Finished up laundry before we had to get to volleyball at 8:30.

	Wasn’t super into it, was feeling weird from both being hungover earlier and some effects of starting keto again so felt really sluggish. Lost game one, everyone played like shit. Didn’t help that we only had 5. Games two and three were much better, won them both. Hopefully we’ll do better this weekend during the tournament!

	9/13
	x2

	Long day at work, starting to get spread a little thin. I’m now on 5 projects when I’m only actually budgeted for 1. Stayed until 6 to catch up, hoping tomorrow will be less hectic.

	Squeezed a workout in but it wasn’t the most successful, I felt pretty weak so didn’t go 100%. Need to start counting my macros if I’m going to be working out this hard on keto.

	L had her Target Corp meeting today, Dave Matthews played and the super fucking annoying gay dude from queer guy was there. Sounds hellish.

	Lacey and I made keto chicken alfredo with miracle noodles, was pretty dang tasty. She also made some keto brownies which were surprisingly really good too.

	She’s struggling a bit with the sugar cravings but it definitely helps that there are so many fat bomb options.

	Watched Ozark s2e7 tonight, the show just keeps getting crazier.

	9/14
	x3

	Couldn’t sleep last night so researched skis/ski boots and mapped out every ski resort in Minnesota. Bring on skiing season!

	Picked up tickets for Brett, Lacey, and I for Toe at the fine line. It’s their first time in Mpls so I was pretty excited to see them. They were incredible aside from the vocals which may have been close to the worse I’ve heard, unfortunate.

	David was in town and him and Dustin went to Andrew WK at Varsity, looked like a good time. AWK shows usually are.

	9/15
	x4

	Lacey and my anniversary, 5 years today! Time seriously flies when you have a beautiful, funny, caring, smart and just downright cool fiancée who makes your every living day exponentially better. Love that girl.

	Castle Danger Volleyball tournament at Memory Lanes with Dig Dug (Lacey, Matt, Woody, and Amy). The day was brutally hot, 90 degrees and humid as hell. 

	Finished pool play with a 3-3 record, 5th place out of 8. By our third match the sun was already getting to us.. we started playing pretty sloppily and it didn’t make matters and better playing with 5. 

	Lost our first game in the single elim bracket so we ended the tourney early but I honestly don’t think anyone minded since the thought of playing back to back sounded terrible.

	Lacey surprised me with a really sweet card for our anniversary. Little does she know that I got her a “Sleep With Me” podcast shirt and I think she’ll love it, it’ll be here Monday. 

	Made some keto nachos and finished Ozark season 2. Ole Marty Byrde is in quite the bind.

	9/16

	Day spend doing bills, organizing some documents, and deep cleaning the house. David, Olivia, and friends were getting drinks in NE so we joined them at Stanley’s (they were very nice).

	There was some drama ensuing as we got there, some bar patron (identity in question) had left their dog in their car with windows up. Stanley’s bar manager considered breaking out the windows, but the owner of the vehicle auto started it just in time. The manager called the cops and as they arrive the man who owned the vehicle was getting in his car. They seized the dog, retrieved his bar tab, gave him a breathalyzer.. our eavesdropping only led us that far.

	Biked home around noon to beat the impending storm. The forecast was looking grim and I didn’t want to get stuck in the rain.

	Downloaded a bunch of “free” comedy albums from Howl. I wonder how many paid services just naively host their MP3 files on their server for anyone to grab for free? 

	Started the series Forever with Fred Armisen and Mia Rudolph, so far so good. They are pretty much us.

	I made some crepes, or attempted to anyways. 2 of 6 turned out. L made some delicious keto cookies.

	I wrapped up her gift and gave it to her; a purple Sleep With Me shirt. She loved it.

	9/18

	Early morning gym session. Lacey did my ketogains 5x5 routine with me. She was really uncomfortable lifting the bar bell but I think felt better after doing it. She wants to do it again with me Thursday.

	I forgot my belt and socks so made a quick trip to Nordstrom after sitting in IDS watching a couple birds play by the fountain as I waited for them to open. Left with a new belt, socks, sweatpants, and a windbreaker. Woops!

	Feeling good today, brain feels clear. Mood is positive. Body feels healthy. My clothes are fitting better. The weight behind my eyes seems to have lifted. 

	Fitter. Happier. More productive.

	9/19

	Last softball games of fall session 1, won both.

	9/20

	Had a lunch meeting with Courtney and Rachel from Apex at Hen House. It went well, they’re both really nice. Found out they place contractors in Denver so there’s an opportunity there if we did want to move.

	Worked from home for the rest of the day.

	Volleyball was a bust, lost 2 of 3. We played horribly again, idk what our deal is lately.

	9/21

	Eli bought tickets for Mercury Program in Brooklyn so we’ll be going there on the 15th of Nov. we rented an air bnb in Greenpointe, kind of close to the venue, BK Bazaar. They just rereleased A Data Learn Language on vinyl and are playing it in it’s entirety. Top 3 album for me and bucket list band, check.

	Scheduled our flights for New York and Miami.

	Raining hard out today, not being very productive. Going to gym and ride the rest of this work day out.

	Lacey and I had to satisfy our pinball craving so we played a bit at Morts and some more at Tilt. We were both feeling pretty keto-weak and caved. I got a cider and a beer and we binge ate McDonald’s and watched Forever. So gluttonous. But so satisfying.

	9/22

	Perfect sunny day in northeast. We didn’t have a single plan so we decided to just hop around NE and play the day by ear.

	We got espresso at Maeve’s, checked out some new frames, wandered around a used book store, hung out at Dangerous Man, and ended up at 331 where Korman met up with us. Had a couple shots and stopped next door at the Sheridan Room where Ryan and Brett met us. 

	Brett had a flat so we went to Korman’s to get his pump and get the house tour since we hadn’t been there. 

	Next stop was Able and a greasy visit to Uncle Frankie’s before a quick night cap (9pm) at Sprig Street.

	9/23

	Had a nice day with Lacey. Made a trip to Duluth Trading Co, I got some new underwear, a shirt, and a new hoodie since I lost my DTC one somehow.

	She needed to return a few things at the Rosedale mall so made a pit stop there. While there I realized that my Dangerous Man hoodie was super discolored from sitting in the sun so I took that back to exchange it. There were some cheese samples there so naturally we had to get a brick and had a few beers next door.

	We were waiting for Ray Jays happy hour so we decided to people watch and kill some time at the New Bohemian patio before making it over to RJs for some apps. We both called our moms and just soaked up the sun.

	I decided I was still hungry some how so I ordered dominoes and played rocket league. 

	We tried to watch Mandy but weren’t really following it so we stopped half way through, we’ll probably give it another shot this week.

	Ate so many carbs this weekend, going to feel good to get back to the gym.

	9/24 - Mon

	Fast forward, gym session was pretty unproductive. Felt pretty weak and wasn’t in the mood but at least I went.

	Sold my juicer for $70, kind of sad to let it go since it was a gift from Mom but it hasn’t been used in over a year and took up a ton of space. Going to put the money towards and Apple Watch.

	Finished Forever, which was pretty mediocre overall. It’s too bad because the first episode was so good.

	9/25 - Tues

	Slept in and almost was late to my 9:15. Sat I’m on an interview with someone interviewing for UIDD, David Monsoon, seems like a cool dude.

	9/26

	WFH. Didn’t really have much work to do other than reply to a few emails and send over a couple files so I slept in a little, played some video games, and figured out some tax shit. We had volleyball, won all 3. Ashley was back from her month long Montana journey; we play much better with 6.

	It was sunny but chilly, starting to get to the point where you can hardly feel your feet after a game from the cold sand.

	I messaged Lori about Lacey’s bday present this year, a puppy, asking for some suggestions. I have her a list of wants and it really sounds like a goldendoodle would be perfect for us. They’re great with people, cuddly, and also great with cats. It’s official, we’re finally getting a dog; I think Lacey will be ecstatic.

	9/27

	Standard work day. Softball Fall League #2 started. We played a pretty amateur team, 10 runner them both games. Game one I hit a 3 run walkoff home run.

	Post softball I met up with Dignan and Ryan (who was on his way to a ‘soirée’ hosted by his realtor) at Moose and then swung over to Spring Street to meet up with Korman and his (new) roommate Matt. Vikings were playing so the bars were crazy busy. I didn’t really give a shit about the game but it was good to hang out.

	9/28

	Woke up early to mentally prepare for a design presentation. All my designs printed out black and white so off to a great start. The other presenter of the day, Chad, didn’t realize he was supposed to present so added pressure on me. I ended up presenting/discussing for 45 min.. towards the end I was getting a little fatigued but I think it went alright overall. My socially anxious brain looked up at one point and noticed Steven making eye contact with Andy and smirking so that through me off a bit but I tried to shake it off and recovered. Overall the discussion went well and I took away a lot of good feedback. 

	Got off work early to get home and pack up for the camping trip with Amanda and Jay at Pattinson State Park.

	We made a stop at Dultuth Trading Co. to return some things and to the liquor store quick. Got some High West whiskey based off of a recommendation by some random guy there.

	Bib Tucker
	J - “I thought it said Bib Fucker”
	L - “I thought it said Butt Fucker”

	We got there around 5 or so, the weather was overcast, cold, and misty and I wasn’t super thrilled about it. The ground in our campsite was chalk full of rocks, luckily we had our air mattress. 

	We finally got all set up and got a fire started. Amanda’s cousin Mike and his friend Corbin joined us; they brought some Kraken rum. We all sat around the fire having a few drinks, Jay had a few too many and had to call it a night after chopping down dead trees and almost falling into the fire. We stayed up a bit more and quickly realized that although Mike was a nice guy, he was definitely a right wing pro gun nut who wants to arm teachers. What do you do..

	9/29

	Made some breakfast and went for a hike to the Manitau Falls; the largest waterfall in Wisconsin. The water was stained brown from all the minerals and literally looked like root beer. 

	Afterwards we headed north to Gooseberry Falls and met up with Mike and gang for another hike. Gooseberry was pretty cool but after 2 hours of hiking I was pretty over it, especially since the rest of the crew kept veering off and goofing off.

	We finally made it out of there, got some pies at Betty’s Pies, a couple beers at Castle Danger in Two Harbors, and got dinner at the Anchor in Superior. 

	On our way we passed through a tunnel and played Daft Punk - Giorgio Moroder as a tribute to Paul.

	The anchor didn’t really live up to it’s hype, food wise. Otherwise the place is awesome, jammed full of cargo ship memorabilia and other random trinkets. 

	We didn’t have firewood so we went to Menards and got a bunch of discount scrap wood, it ended up burning much better than the campground wood.

	Had some drinks until the fire died down and called it a night.

	9/30 - Sun

	A cool sunny morning. Showered and got packed up. Said farewell to Amanda and Jay and L and I made way to Superior to get lost. First stop was Superior Meats where I bought a bunch of brats and we got a half of a pound of jerky; it didn’t last long.

	We found a cool little place called Globe Newsstand after finding some caffeine that housed a bunch of vinyl, books, and other random items of nerd culture. We left with a Giorgio Moroder soundtrack, coincidence?

	Next stop, randomly found a brewery/pizza shop called the Thirsty Pagan after a wrong turn and stepped in for one. It was really awesome and Lacey had a delicious sour. We were also fond of the liberalesque decor and anti religious themes.

	Next, Earth Rider taproom. Cool spot, had a good red beer and a place from down the street brought in a crockpot full of pulled pork for the patrons so couldn’t say no to free food.

	We drove across the river to Duluth to look around but we decided we’d seen enough and started trekking back. Had some White Castle on the way and ordered some Thai food when we got back that was expensive but really good.

	Last stop Fairstate for a cake drinker and a sour before picking up our food.

	Watched Kidding.

<h3>OCTOBER 2018</h3>

	Oct 1 - Mon
	x1

	WFH 

	Doctors appt with Barb in the AM, found out that I still have high BP (160/90 BP). I talked to her a bit about alcoholism and how it’s not easy for me to quit so she suggested I try the Naltrexone again. I also bought a blood pressure monitor so I can try to be better about not neglecting it.

	Oct 2 
	x2

	WFH again, drove out to Lake Minnetonka to see my CPA to get my revised tax returns. He was able to reduce the proposed 11+k down to around 6k, so at least there’s that. Did some cleaning and laundry.

	Oct 3
	x3

	Super windy out, cold, and wet for volleyball, probably the windiest I’ve ever played in. It was extremely hard to control our passes but we ended up winning so we advanced to the next round of he playoffs.

	Oct 4
	x4

	Early softball double header. It was cold, again.. the weather has been shit lately. I wasn’t really feeling it, we were short guys.. we lost both games.

	First night of fall volleyball, we played the late game and won all 3.

	Oct 5
	x5

	Friday night in with Lacey. Continued watching the Deuce. Broke a 48 hour fast and ate some chili dogs.

	Oct 6

	Woke up early, jogged to the gym for a workout. Got back and L was making some eggs for breakfast. 

	After a week of not drinking and intermittent fasting my blood pressure had already returned to a normal range from hypertension 2.

	I napped for most of the day, woke up around 5. We were kind of feeling restless so we decided to get out for a bit, decided on Spring Street. Got our usual chicken strips and onion rings. A couple shots and beers and we called it a night.

	Oct 7

	Out of coffee so made a stop at Lunds to grab some and got suckered into buying a couple donuts. Did some bills before the matinee, Free Solo.

	Opened my bday present from Lacey, she surprised me with a trip to Wisconsin Dells, we’re going this weekend. Honestly surprised she was able to keep the secret! She invited most of my friends and got us an air bnb. Super nice of her!

	Got to the theater early so we hit up the bloody bar at Uptown Tavern beforehand. The movie was really good, it was about Alex Honnold and his preparation for climbing El Capitan in Yosemite free solo.. some people are literally crazy. I can’t really wrap my head around how that is even possible.

	After the movie we play some pinball at UpDown, got some snacks at Moto-I, and a few beers at Dangerous Man with Korman, Matt, and Matt’s gf.

	I’d been drinking practically all day so I was kind of over socializing so we took off and got Taco Bell.

	Oct 8 - Mon

	Pretty standard work day, didn’t really feel like a bday but there is something nice about everyone not knowing, I of course hate the attention.

	I did however get the contact information to “Superdoodles”, a golden doodle breeder, from Chad at work. I emailed Randy and he got back to me almost immediately and just so happened to have a litter coming near xmas, which would be perfect timing to surprise Lacey for her bday. His rates are cheaper and the dogs are FB2 - non shedding and more golden traits. It’s also reddish gold, so pretty much perfect in every way. Since I got ahold of him first I’ll have first pick of the litter too, I’m excited :)

	Hopped on an 11 after work to find Lacey already on the bus. We decided to hit up a couple happy hours, Stray Dog (we wanted wontons but our server suckedddd), Ray Jays for some boneless drunken wings, and settled on the Red Savoy Monday take-and-bake deal for dinner. The pizza was pretty bomb, we’ll def have to keep that in mind for the next time we’re looking for a frozen pizza.

	32 - Take and bake pizza and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

	Oct 9 - Tues

	Oct 10

	Another cold and rainy night for volleyball. Last night of the playoffs, we barely squeaked by the second round.. we lost game 1 and we’re down 10 in game two but had a great comeback and managed to win that and the tiebreaker to advance us to the championship.

	The championship didn’t really go too great.. we won our first and then fell apart and lost our last two. Once again, we ended up in second place. We’re cursed.

	Oct 11

	Sosickofthisfuckingweather. WFH, planned on going to Red Wing for the warehouse boot sale but it was so gloomy out so I opted out. Took a nap with Huey, got some McDonald’s. 

	Had softball at 6 and 7, got 15 run ruled both games. No one gave a shit and we only had 9. Waste of time.

	We played the late games for indoor volleyball, L and I went to Lowbrow for a pregame drink. Nice atmosphere and actually quiet enough to talk; something hard to find as of late. The bar is topped with old school baseball cards.

	We played short a girl and lost to the knee braced fucker who is always a huge dick. Won our first and lost 2. The birkenstock douche ref made so many bad calls too that just fucked us, overall not a great night for sports.

	Oct 12

	Katie turns 30 today.

	Took off early from work to get home and pack for the weekend. Packed pretty light considering we’d be spending all day Sat at the water park. Drove to St Paul to pick up David and Olivia and decided to go get some juicy Lucy’s at The Nook. I got the Paul Molitor which is a jucy with pepper jack.. it was decent but I still stand by Matt’s as the best. It seemed like it was premade and maybe frozen even before being cooked. We sat in the basement which seemed like a mashup of the Prop and Cuzzie’s with all the dollar bills littering the walls.  We had a clear view of the bowling alley and had a good laugh eavesdropping on some teens.

	“Imagine if you didn’t have any legs”

	The drive went by pretty quick, we got into our air bnb and took a Lyft with Jerry (who we’d have again on the trip). First stop was the Showboat Saloon. Cool bar but fuck it was packed and obnoxiously loud with the Brewers game on. Got a good dose of Trump memorabilia.

	Then checked out “Nigs” for one.. appropriately named I guess for the amount of right wing conservatives there. “Take a Swig with Nig”







	The Changeling
	Coralline
	Zodiac 

	Too funny to fail - Hulu 

	10/15


	Minus the Bear farewell tour at Varsity Theater with Caspian. Lacey and I got a HH at Loring Pasta Bar, it was our first time there. The interior was pretty interesting, a lot of really cool brickwork and a nice ambiance. We then got a couple rounds at Kitty Kat where we met up with Chuck and his buddy Dan who I hadn’t seen for years. We all got photos in the photo booth before heading over to Varsity. We ran into the guitarist outside and exchanged some words. I told him it was my 4th time seeing MTB and would have loved to see Botch in which he replied “And you never will”.

	We got in and Caspian was already playing; shredding per usual. Found Donny and a couple drinks and made way towards the front.

	Minus the Bear was incredible, as always. They started off with Drilling. Played most of the bangers, except no Monkey Knife Fight which I was kind of bummed about.

	Post show Donny, Lacey, and I all got cheesesteaks from Franks From Philly.. best damn cheesesteak I’ve ever had. Red Savoy has been trumped.

	8/16

	Nothing really notable today aside from us  starting watching American Horror Story S1 since Lacey had never seen it. 

	8/17

	WFH, did a bunch of laundry and tried cleaning up our moldy ass basement. So fucking gross down there.

	Worked a bit at 5 Watt; for once I was able to find a table. Working on some filters at work for a news section, felt like I actually made some progress.

	Met L at Moose for a couple quick drinks and came home to deep clean the house before Mom and Dad come this weekend.

	We finally made our Kombucha, it now resides in my closet.

	8/18

	Woke up with a brutal headache so wfh again. Was able to get some aspirin and kick it so I went over to spyhouse to get some work done.. flew through it and took the rest of the day off. Got a couple beers and food from Pinku.. it was so good but pretty pricey and the portion size was extremely small. I got some gyoza, some crispy fried shrimp and rice, and some nigiri salmon roll.

	L and I had a pregame meal at Nighthawks and sat up at the kitchen bar. Crispy chicken sammy and some fries with delicious aoli. She saw a cook cut himself and not clean the knife so there was that..

	Won our volleyball games pretty heavy handidly and got real gross and had McDonald’s and watched American Horror Story..

	8/19

	Going to take off work early to go help Lacey clean a bit. Mom and Dad should be rolling in around 5 and we have reservations for Bar La Grassa tonight, we’re so excited to crush some pasta!

	We took a cab over to north loop to get a drink at bunkers before our reservation.

	BLG was delicious! The interior wasn’t exactly what we’d expected but it was still nice, I guess I had a more laid back, classic Italian place pictured but it was more vibrant and hip and the crowd was young. The server we had was awful though, and the table we were at was super tiny and jam packed full of plates, silverware, and glasses. Dad was not really a fan of the lack of space, we both fumbled some cutlery. We started with soft eggs and lobster and the red onion with goat cheese. Both were awesome but the lobster and eggs took the cake. Mom, Dad, and me all agreed that they were the best eggs we’ve ever had. 

	The menu was pretty overwhelming, we had to google some things but managed. I landed on the foie gras tortellini. My first experience with foie gras and it won’t be my last. Such a rich, buttery, deep flavor paired with the subtle sweetness of berries. So damn good, it was Mom and my favorites. Dad got the red wine spaghetti with pine nuts, he wasn’t really a fan but that was my second choice. Lacey and Mom both got pastas with red sauce, good but not spectacular.

	8/20

	Woke up early and made everyone coffee. We drove to uptown for a few bloodies at uptown tav and decided we wanted to try the fried chicken at Bonchon since it was super hyped up. We got there and were told there was a 20 min wait so we made way to Columbia so Mom could get a new coat, she found a really nice one. The 20 min turned to an hour so we explored the kitchen store in Calhoun square before heading back over.

	Finally got a table and ordered.. the menu was a bit unimpressive and frankly the food was too. Does not live up to the hype.

	Continued on in uptown, Morts for some foosball and pre-ed-Sheeran drinks for Mom and Dad.

	Dropped them off and Lacey and I spent the night over at Spring Street. Got our usual chicken strips and onion rings along with some tequila. While standing up at the bar to get another drink L looked at me and said she saw a $100 bill on the ground and sure enough there was one a couple of feet away. We tactically shifted over, I stepped on it, and I pretended to tie my shoe as I slipped the bill in my pocket. 

	Elated, we ordered shots. I checked it out in the bathroom considering I thought it was too good to be true but it was legit!

	We decided to order Phillies again from Franks as a reward and watched making of a murder :)

	Moms phone died when trying to get a cab after the show.

	8/21

	Parents took off early. We felt spontaneous so we took a day trip to Stillwater.

	Tiki drinks in the sun room.

	Chips and queso at Nacho Mama.

	Spent entirely too long in an antique store.

	Lift Bridge for a shitty beer.

	10/22

	10/23

	10/24

	10/25

	Tequila and Rocket League.

	10/26

	Busy day at work, had to work through lunch but am happy about learning more complex methods of using GIT. 

	Post work beers at Dangerous Man with Lacey and Korman. Stood around for a bit but found a good spot at the bar. Rare to find a spot to sit.

	Made a stop at home to meet Korman, he needed a costume for a Halloween party later in the night and we had our leftover Walter & Jesse Breaking Bad costumes.. he chose the Heisenberg.

	Lyfted to Pryes and met up with Anna and Ryan before they went to see Mitski. Got some bomb cheesy fries and nitro beers.

	L and I decided to stay out a bit, hung out at Moose and then walked down to Hennepin to try to find some food. First stopped at the new bar Dirty Martini, it was awful and we didn’t get served so we left. Then tried Macs, no service so we left. Landed on New Bohemia and got a cheesy baked potato, carb overload. 

	10/27

	Northeast Halloween hangs for Olivia’s (Scream stab victim) bday. L was “mom’s spaghetti” and I was lazy so I just corpse painted my grandpa mask; “Gothgrandpa”. 

	First stop was Norseman, it took way too long to get drinks. I was unimpressed with the size of my 10$ cocktail. There was an awkward dance party that seemed more like a middle school dance with people hanging out at the outskirts of the floor.

	Korman (sailor) got a tarot card reading.

	Next stop was Sportys where we hung out for a bit, played buck hunter (buckzilla!). Randomly ran into Rebecca Mogen there, she didn’t seem too interested in talking to us. Ryan (zingy stardust) and Anna (Elton John) met us there.

	Last stop was Spring Street.

	10/28

	L and I drove out to Minnetonka to meet Cindy and her Gma for lunch at Yum Bakery. The day was nice and we sat at a sunny table that was shaded by the blinds. Darlene and I got the fish and chips, a mashed potato pizza for Lacey, and Salmon for Cindy. Talked about Hawaii and Lacey’s cousin’s infidelity/divorce which sounded like a nightmarish situation. Glad we don’t live in a constant state of stress.

	We met Dustin, Camille, David, Ryan, and Dustin’s cousin Drew at Top Golf at 5:30. It was really fun, I hadn’t swung a club in years so I was a bit rusty but it could have been worse. Hung out for a few hours, had some drinks and apps. L and I got Checkers/Ralleys on the way home and I seriously think it might be my new favorite fast food spot. Both the chicken sandwich and burger were better than McDonald’s and still cheap af.

	“Here’s a free lesson for you (no look swing - duff)” - Dustin

	10/29

	Day went by fast, been really busy at work the past week. Cleaned out the basement a bit more and organized the back storage area. Also did some laundry, very domestic night.

	10/30

	Was invited to a work happy hour for a project I wasn’t a part of, but I went anyways and had a lot of fun. There was an open bar and free food at the mezzanine level of the Local. I’d never been up there before but it was a nice space with a pool table so got a few games in, talked shop, and had some drinks.

	Afterwards I met Lacey at St Anthony for Mid-90s. We both really enjoyed it. Being a parent would be super conflicting; wanting your kid to have friends but not being able to understand the friends they do choose to spend their time with..

	10/31

	Drank in secret again tonight. It makes me so ashamed that it’s not something I can control. Waking up in the mornings constantly worrying about my health is not a desirable feeling. 

	Was trying to organize some old photos and postcards that I pulled out from storage and came across an unsent, sealed letter that I had wrote to Kelli almost 10 years ago. Crazy to think that much time had passed and crazy to think I still was holding onto the letter. I had over the years questioned myself about what had gone wrong, or if I was really just too immature for a relationship but after reading the letter I was reminded of how much I did care and how much I tried to make it work. I think emotionally she needed someone to literally take care of her because she just wasn’t strong enough on her own.

	10 years later and here I am, after finally finding myself and seeing what happiness can really be. Lacey is the best thing that’s ever happened to me and sometimes you need to endure the struggles in order to find true love.

	Halloween; we already costumes up over the past weekend so we decided to stay in. We ate pulled pork sandwiches and watched Good Time which was really friggen good actually.

<h3>NOVEMBER 2018:</h3>

	11/1/18

	Woke up early, worried about my health. Feeling fat from drinking so much beer lately and shoveling in garbage food. 

	Volleyball tonight against Droppin’ Plates, they were undefeated last year and are in 1st again this year.

	11/2

	Bought Red Dead Redemption 2. Started playing it and realized our shitty tv has dead pixels right where it displays instructions. I ended up buying a new monitor with the money I got from selling my Mac.

	11/3

	Red Dead all day. Walked to the store to get some Mac and Cheese and some more beers, but other than that we didn’t leave the house. Lacey cleaned out her closet, found some moths.

	11/4

	Lacey went to a movie while I cleaned up a bit and played PS4.

	Spent a majority of the day playing RD. Tried selling mom’s juicer but I listed it incorrectly and it didn’t sell. 

	Met up with Pat, Maggie, Ryan, and Luke at Surly for a couple pre show beers.

	This Will Destroy You with Steve Hauschildt at the Turf Club. 

	People behind me were talking constantly during TWDY. Unlike me but I confronted them and told them to the the conversation elsewhere.. the dude didn’t like the suggestion. After he stopped with his cocktail remarks the chatter died down, I’ll chalk that up as a win.

	The show was good, had seen them before so nothing completely new. 

	Hauschildts visuals were really cool, they were all visualizations that were color mapped to his midi controller. It was all abstract but it was live.

	“Colon Stetson at the Turd Club” - Lacey

	11/5

	Feeling bloated, tired, and anxious today. Almost certain it’s from drinking. This weekend was a bender, I didn’t really stop drinking from the time I got off work Fri to the time I went to bed last night.

	Found out Anna’s uncle just passed away yesterday; routine checkup turned into immediate major surgery to induced coma and plug pulled. Likely complications due to drinking. It’s so obvious that I need to stop. 

	Today has just felt like impending doom, nothing has really changed, but this anxiety is different today. I feel like the world could end at any moment.

	Here’s to day 1 again. Picked up a Red Savoy Monday take-and-bake-special pizza on my way home from work and took a nice nap when I got home.

	Watched a show about 90’s tv and hit the hay early.

	Lacey got an iPhone X and spent most of her night fiddling with it.

	11/6

	Woke up early and got to work by 7:30. Mornings in the office when no one is around are my favorite.

	Felt better today. Miracles a good night’s sleep can do. Found out I’m moving teams today, instead of Spencer I’ll be reporting to Peter. I’m alright with it, my work won’t really change too much, but Peter seems more high maintenance so hopefully the shift won’t bring stress.

	I got an unexpected email today from Superdoodles, our puppy has been born! (Born on 11/1/2018). The litter was 4 girls and 2 boys. Now I need to figure out how I’m logistically going to make this surprise work.

	“Burped” the kombucha, there’s a little carbonation starting to happen but I still think we have a ways to go.

	11/7

	11/8

	Worked from home, didn’t have a lot to do so it was a pretty relaxing day.

	Played Matt Ruoho and Jamie Lieser (product owner/portfolio owner at Ampf) in volleyball. We won all 3 but they put up a good fight with only 5. 

	11/9

	I had a presentation in the morning.. literally to just talk about a filter design. Woke up early to mentally prepare. It went ok. It was only for 5 people and lasted maybe only 10 minutes but I still don’t think I’ll ever be used to it. 

	Lacey went back to Iowa to hang with her family for Lori’s 60th and Kait’s 32nd bdays. We got them some succulents and her mom a llama planter (Lloyd).

	Night to myself, mostly gamed and had a few (10) beers. Woops.

	11/10

	Bachelor day at home. Me, the cats, beers, and PS4. Soaked my King of Slubs and picked up the house. Bottled the kombucha after a carbonation explosion!  Brought in all of our patio furniture and the bikes, sad.

	Took a nice long nap in the afternoon, was going to go hang with Korman and some others but really didn’t feel like leaving so just gamed all night.

	11/11

	Got a few things done around the house in between long stints of gaming. Propagated some devils ivy that we had growing roots for over a year. Hung up Lacey’s closet shoe organizer. Cord organization in the office. Dishes. I told Korman I’d get brunch but I didn’t really feel like socializing again so hung around home all day. Walked to the liquor store to get more whiskey.. why? Idk. It’s a strange feeling when your brain is criticizing you for going but your legs just keep moving anyways.

	Played some more league with David and ordered some Pizza Hut. Such a sucker for stuffed crust pizza. Almost ate the whole pie; a very gluttonous day indeed.

	11/12

	Tough time waking up today. I’m feeling very off, anxiety sets in once again.

	More Naltrexone, it helps keep my mind off drinking. Lacey is home tonight, she’s picking up pho on the way.

	Sometimes I feel like I have a very deep understanding of the world but it’s just hard for me to express and or relate that to other people.

	11/13

	Listening: Cult Leader - A Patient Man

	Got my preorder Mercury Program ADLTL vinyl.

	Lacey wasn’t feeling well so she took a bath and relaxed after work.

	Leftover pho and jeapoardy.

	11/14

	Total Home Alone situation this morning. Lacey woke me up by shaking me and yelling my name.. I thought I had overslept for work.. turns out our flight that we had thought was scheduled for tomorrow was actually for today. We called Southwest to get a new flight scheduled but at the cost of 40,000 more bonus points :(

	Bummer start to the day, and the lady next to me on the bus was the loudest gum smacked I’d ever heard. 

	Double whammy.

	11/15

	Atlanta Lounge - bartender - happiness drink - sour rum 

	Flight with puppy 

	Lyft ride from the airport to Green Point. Lots of snow, bad drivers, and horns honking. First snow of the season.

	Later found out that NYC got six inches, the most for a November day in 136 years.

	Mercury Program and Square Peg Round Hole at Brooklyn Bazaar.

	Slushy walk home in the sleet, stopped at Tommy’s Tavern before the bodega on our block to get some munchies.

	11/16

	Day started off beautiful. 40’s-50’s, all the snow had melted by the time we got outside. Full day in Brooklyn, lots of walking. I was technically working remote so we stopped into a coffee shop nearby (champion coffee) so I could get a few things done. Next stop was some bloodies, we landed on a place called Enid’s and walked south about 20 min to get there stopping into a few shops along the way. Bloody was good but pricey. Next stops included a bizarre bait shop/record store that had a shop car who looked like it had seen some shit over the years. Frankel’s jewish deli, we got the egg and pastrami bagel. Finally wound up at Sunshine Laundromat where there was a speak easy type barcade in the back which housed probably 30 pinball machines. We spend a good chunk of time there and made way to Eli’s apartment in Williamsburg. 

	Barstool Pizza

	Currywurst and a Hofbrau Dunkle at Radegast Brew Hall. 

	Joe’s Pizza slices. Mushroom was incredible but might have just been drunk.

	Worlds best pickleback? Idk. Tasted like red wine vinegar.

	Horses and Divorces bar with Burt Reynolds mural. 

	Looking for some late night food, tried McDonald’s but they closed right as we got there. Hanging out outside trying to decide what to get a passerbyer also so McDs was closed and just yells: “Cuntsssss! ... Cuntsssssss!”

	We decided on another bodega.

	11/17 - Sat

	Another long day of walking. By the end of it Lacey and my dogs were borkin’.

	We had a dim sum lunch date with Eli at Tim Ho Wan in Manhattan which we were late for since we got lost on our way to the subway. Luckily we showed up just in time for our reservation. The place was packed and not very spacious. We were offered some lavender milk tea while we waited and were seated at a small table near the back. We got some shumai, rice and pork rolls, silky milk fried whatevers, and a bunch of the most delicious pork buns I think I’ve ever had. Left stuffed and satisfied. 

	Got coffee at a hip little spot nearby and walked to Central Park. L had been joking about how bad she wanted to see the new resident Mandarin duck which we happened to spot immediately. There were hoards of people gathered to witness it swimming around along with the other ducks. The colors were quite impressive but the amount of gawkers kind of ruined the majesty.

	After the park we checked out the new Nike store and roamed through Time’s Square where I was verbally assaulted by the naked cowboy: “I don’t care if you e got fucked up ears, that’s your own problem”

	We were getting tired so we stopped for a rest and a drink at nearby pub where a moose head silently peered over us as our Russian bartender served us. 

	Next we started walking towards John’s on Bleecker St. in lower Manhattan for some traditional NY pizza pie. Stopped at the Chelsea Market along the way for a bathroom pitstop; the place was chock full of yuppies in Canada Goose parkas. Strode through Lacey’s old neighborhood where she interned and she got a cupcake.

	The wait at John’s was minimal. We got a classic pepperoni and a mushroom with a pitcher. Really good coal fired pie but I think we all agreed it wasn’t the best we’d ever had; L and I prefer Punch.

	Following we made way to Decible which is a sort-of underground sake bunker. The vibe was really cool, low lit with tons of graffiti and stickers populating the walls. We tried a couple unfiltered/milky sakes and fell in love. Since L and I had to leave in the morning we made way back to Brooklyn.

	When we made it back to Green Point we stopped back into Sunshine since Eli had yet to check it out. Played a few games and started back towards to apt. Lacey was tired so she stayed in and Eli and I went to Tommy’s Tavern for a “night cap”
	and a game of pool.

	We had a few and played some pool. A couple came by wanting to play so Eli asked if they wanted to play us for the table.. they said yes but didn’t really understand what that meant so naturally were not too happy to discover after paying for the game they still had to play us. Dude was kind of a bitch about it but fuck him for not knowing the protocol. We kind of fucked around and lost anyways so we went to play steel tip instead.

	There was a guy already throwing and we asked him if he wanted to play some cricket. He obliged and we got to talking. The dude was super nice and interesting. 

	The drinks were flowing and we started noticing some weird shit going down. There was a guy who sat in the corner seat just observing for hours.. occasionally talking to random people. Then the guy we were playing with (Tim) suddenly went to the bar, grabbed a package, and took it outside. While I was in the bathroom Eli was talking to another guy who told him he used to hide lbs of coke in the pool table. We were obviously observing an operation going down. So we got to thinking we should maybe try to score.

	It was late (2-3am) and I had to leave for our flight home around 4:30 so I just decided to tough it out and stay up. Around 3:30 Eli called it quits and we parted ways but as I was leaving, the guy who mentioned his pool stash said to me “I got what you want, tell me what you need”.. I told him to hold on for a minute and I called Eli back. We discussed and went and got some cash out. The guy was kind of jerking us around, told us he needed cash in hand and needed to go pick it up.. we said we needed the product during the exchange so he told us to wait for him in the bar so we did. 15 min later we were feeling sketched out since he wasn’t back and left.

	R taco for lunch. 

	Surdyks for some unfiltered sake.

	11/19 - Mon

	Day back, recovering and tired. Home from work and to bed early.

	11/20 - Tues

	Finally a little caught up. Packed up a bit.

	Vacationnn brain. L and I hit up Moose happy hour, got a few jump ups. Talked to her about my addiction, we all know it’s a problem.. just trying to manage it the best I can and I think she understands but feels helpless :(

	11/21 - Wed

	Lacey and I decide to get to Watertown a day early since we were both wfh and didn’t really have much to do. 

	Got some delicious subs from Casey’s. Had some drinks at home with Mom and Dad, told them all about our New York trip. 

	11/22 - Thurs

	Another lazy Thanksgiving. Got up and made the pickle wraps. Started Dune, bummed around the house, ate my weight in horderves. Mom bribed grandma Goos to come over for dinner by driving her out to the casino the night prior. She looked pretty brittle but she seems much better mentally since we saw her last at the home. 

	Stupidest thing said - garbage burn why can’t you feed t to the cattle - Dad 

	11/23 - Fri

	Got lunch with Mom at Guadalajara’s. Got a couple margs, chips and queso, and a chalupa. Our portions were all huge so we were pretty stuffed. The queso was bomb but the meat in our tacos wasn’t very seasoned. We then hit up a couple thrift stores with little luck, just a whole bunch of garbage.

	We still had some time before the movie so we made a power nap pit stop at home before heading over to the Oddyssey Theater. We were all still too full for popcorn. The theater is pretty nice; leather reclining seats. Had I not just napped I probably could have fallen asleep. 

	We saw Widows and was pretty glad we saw it instead of Bohemian Rhapsody. One of the better films I’ve seen in a while. Dad didn’t want to come because he was concerned that his coughing would be a distraction.. wish he would just kick the smokes.

	Randomly saw Brian Denman at the theater, he was with his daughter “Smith” who was 6 months old.. she apparently wasn’t loving the Grinch. 

	Had a few whiskeys at home and decided to go downtown. Trav was manning the bar at Sparkys so free drinks were flowing. After a few games of foos, some small talk, and multiple shots later I was pretty wasted so had to cut the night short. The night was nice and I needed the fresh air so Lacey and I walked home, made some junk food and crashed. Downtown Watertown has over the years been losing it’s appeal.

	11/24 - Sat

	Got lunch with Mom and Dad at Dempsey’s, it’s been years since I’ve been there but quickly remembered how much I like that place. 

	We got a pizza; chicken bacon ranch for Lacey and I. It was pretty damn good and we already plan on going back next time we’re in town.

	After pizza we went to Sparkys to play some foosball and have a few cocktails. We crushed Mom and Dad which usually isn’t the case, but we were playing really well. Could tell Dad was getting frustrated. 

	After we got home we started prepping for dinner. We were trying to replicate the lobster and soft eggs we had all gotten at Bar La Grassa. We steamed the lobster and Mom scrambled the eggs. I’d say overall it was pretty damn good even though the Crustini’s got burnt.

	Dad brought out some old photos and belongings of grandpas, I acquired an old stopwatch, some pins, and a money clip. He showed us the urn which was surprisingly heavy for how small it was. I looked at the ashes; strange thinking that grandpa existed in the chalky white powder.

	After dinner we all unwound and watched some jeapardy and some Jim Gaffigan standup.

	Got up and got on the road pretty early. Huey knew we were leaving and tried his best to avoid it, I found him hiding under the bed.

	Starting my detox today. Turned down Casey’s pizza for some beef jerky.

	Found out that Randy wants us to come pick out our puppy on Sunday. Looks like xmas is coming early for Lacey! I bought a bunch of stuff on Mom and Dad’s Amazon account so she wouldn’t suspect anything.

	Made the brats I got in Superior with a big batch of kraut. Very German(e).

	Wasn’t feeling great mentally at work so took off a little early; got a lot done but my social anxiety is flaring up again. Blaming it on the weather. Had to get home and intercept some packages anyways.

	Worked from home. Tidied up the house a bit, listed my Xbox 360 on craigslist, picked up Lacey’s dry cleaning, stopped into Chuck & Don’s for another dog toy, and got L an xmas card (dog themed). I have mostly everything for her gift except the collar which I really hoped would show.. it’s a nice leather collar from Leather Works Minnesota. I guess she’ll have to wait for that.

	Played some Red Dead for a few hours before volleyball. We won all 3 and secured the 2nd seed. Playoffs start next week but we’ll be gone; seeing Thom Yorke!

	Came home, ate, and watched the Jeopardy Teen Tournament of Champions. Hah the questions are a little bit more our speed which makes us feel idiotic for not knowing more regular jeopardy questions. What do ya do?

	Watching: 10 Cloverfield Lane

	Feeling pretty out of it today. Slept super hard but still feel like I could use more.

	Had Lacey open her gift today. I sneakily recorded it.

	I first had her open the bowls and brush. Totally unassuming since we needed both. “These bowls are big but they should work”. Next the hideously in-proportionate sock monkey which she thought was very odd. Next the kong.. “I don’t think these are for cat’s...”. Still didn’t know but maybe suspicious. Then I had her open the card which was a letter pressed xmas card of a dog with antlers. Her face was priceless and she cried as I expected. She said this was the most surprised she’s ever been and was in shock for the rest of the night. 

	I dun gud 😊

<h3>DECEMBER 2018</h3>
	~~~~~~~~~~~~

	12/1 - Sat

	Woke up and cleaned a bit after sleeping in until 11 which felt amazing. We saw that there was snow in the forecast so we left to run some errands before it hit. Got rid of a bunch of clothes at buffalo exchange, recycled some old computers (RIP to my first 17” MacBook Pro that got me through graphic design school at MSCTC), and donated what was left of the clothes to Goodwill. Felt good purging all our old crap.

	Night of gaming for the both of us.


	12/2 - Sun
	x7

	PUPPY DAY! 

	The roads were plowed so we decided to still try to make the trip despite the recent snow. We left around 8 am and arrived in Cold Spring shortly after 10.

	We pulled up to a massive house on the lake and met Randy (along with our new pups Dad; Dirk). He took us downstairs (it was like my dream basement complete with theater, bar, pool table, buck hunter machine..) to meet the litter and when he brought them out I was amazed at how small they actually were, so much smaller than they had looked in the pictures! They were all so adorable but immediately “Pedro” took a liking to Lacey and curled up right in her lap and fell asleep. The other darker red boy, Julio, was a really good looking puppy too and had a bunch of curls already forming on his earls but seemed a bit skittish so we ultimately went with Pedro, who’s new name will be Osker. Lacey was all smiles for the rest of the trip home, we’re both extremely excited to be able to bring him home in early January.

	When we got home we made a trip to Chuck & Dons and got a few more puppy supplies and a quick stop into Lunds for some groceries. 

	We made a chicken crust pizza and watched more Kidding; however the episodes were disappointing.

	One week sober and on keto despite the cravings.

	12/3 - Mon

	Playing: RDR2 
	Reading: Dune/Vacationland
	Listening: Fennesz
	Watching: Curb

	Kind of a wash day at work.. not having a PM is difficult. I don’t feel like it’s my job to manage a project..

	Got off early and ran into Lacey on the 11; it seems to be becoming a commonality. 

	Read a few chapters of vacationland before bed, kind of a nice change from Cops.

	12/4
	Listening: TCGTE/Daniel Avery

	Blood pressure back in normal range and weight down to 213. 13lbs to go to hit my cruise target. Can’t believe I let myself get so fat sometimes, pretty gross.

	Slight anxiety today and yesterday, not sure why. Maybe it’s the coffee? Strange how some days I’m very confident and others I feel like and intruder.

	Bored at work, looking for storage benches so we can store our shoes in the entryway without Osker tearing them all to shreds.

	Bus ride home, struggling with cravings again. I caved unfortunately when I went to sell my aero garden. Maybe Surdyks isn’t the best meeting spot for someone trying to stay sober. Had a .375 of whiskey, basically just put me to sleep after I gamed for a bit.

	12/5

	Woke up groggy, L and I had a hard time getting up. Feeling bloated today so I’m going to workout and fast.

	Slow day at work again, watching a course on css grid.

	12/6

	Worked from home, not much to do, slept in, replied to a few emails, got my haircut, and mostly played RD all day.

	Thom Yorke at the Northrop. Lacey and I went to Loring Pasta Bar for happy hour before. I got the mussels and they were shit. There was some sort of sausage in the sauce that tasted days old and microwaved. L’s potstickers were decent but she honestly makes better herself. We also had a bad spot at the bar after being kicked out of a table for only having the two of us. Won’t be back for a while. 

	Next Kitty Kat, got a drink. Awkward vibes between L and I today, she’s mad at me for breaking our no drink December. Feeling annoyed because I’m perceiving monitoring.. reminds me of post hospitalization and the air surrounding all my relationships at the time; unsureness. Just felt the eyes constantly watching me, judging me, and I felt trapped and pushed me to isolation. It just makes me want to seclude and be alone. I don’t know if this is selfish of me, it seems to be a bit, but I still need the space to make my own decisions and trust that I’ll deal with it my own way while I navigate cutting back. Ryan met us there after we pitifully played pinball.

	Not in a great mood, the air outside was fucking frigid. Found our seats, were were super high up. Could not even decipher the opener (Oliver Coates), although it sounded good. Reminiscent of Colin Stetson but on the cello.

	Thom’s set was a bit more discernible. He was really animated, the visuals (Tarik Barri) were phenomenal, and he sounded great. His robotic wiggly gyrations were almost comedic at times but it was enjoyable to watch him flail about. Harrowdown during encore one might have stolen the show for me.

	Encore two was pretty beautiful too, a song from Suspiria. “The director asked me to make something really sweet about exploding heads; I didn’t bat an eye at that. And well, this is it.” - Thom

	Lyfted home, a bit less awkward now but still tension in the air. Hope tomorrow is better, this is unlike us.  

	12/7

	Weight: 211 - Down 11lbs since thanksgiving

	Work holiday party at Can Can Wonderland; my suggestion. Hope it’s fun and not too anxiety provoking. 

	Lacey and I dipped out of work a little early and grabbed happy hour at Lyon’s Pub; a couple drinks, some slightly disappointing chicken strips, and Cajun fries. Was some of the first carbs I’d had in a while so I didn’t care. We then took the green line to St Paul and walked up to Can Can. The area seemed really desolate; a lot of factories. Getting into Can Can was also a trip, we had to go down a long corridor and into a basement just to get there. No one from Ameriprise was there yet so we did a couple laps to check it out. “Tappy Hour” was happening in the back where people could come and partake in free tap dance lessons. One guy brought his own top hat and cane; quite bizarre.

	The drink situation there was interesting. It was a pour-your-own beers and cocktails which just tallied the amount of ounces you poured. Dangerous but the cocktails were delicious.

	Everyone showed up right around 6 (Casey and her fiancée, Jordan and his wife, Spencer, Billy, Aisha, Kelsey, and David). Was a good crew. Mini golf was fun but a little long. After golf we played some of the old school mechanical machines which were really fun despite looking otherwise.

	The crew disappated pretty quickly afterwards and Lacey and I went to Blackstack for a night cap. It was spacious and homie and we lounged amongst a variety of houseplants in mid century modern furniture.

	Tried to get Red Savoy but got pestered by the worker there about socialism instead so we just went home and made a Lotsa Motsa instead.

	12/8 - Sat

	Went to uptown for some bloodies and pinball. First stop was Morts, played a few games before we decided to get food. I was wearing my Matt’s shirt so it was maybe coincidental (or just subconscious reasoning) that we chose to go there. It’d been way too long.. it was as good as we remembered (although more expensive). L’s first Lucy with onions. For future reference.. they don’t have any ranch.

	“Ya got ranch?” - Me
	“Nope *runs away* - Waitress

	On the way back we popped into Midtown for the xmas makers market. L got a candle, I got a Krampus ornament. Stopped at East Lake Brewery to give it a second chance; our first experience wasn’t the greatest. This time around the beers were really good and they had a few pins in the back, LOTR being one of them.

	Pretty exhausted from peopling we called it a day. Only thing missing in our lives was pizza so we got gross and ordered Pizza Hut which surprisingly came early for once. The delivery driver maybe have been the most awkward teen I’ve ever met, I think he was extremely high and only could muster a few squeaks when trying to communicate. 

	12/9
	Watching: Curb

	Wanted to get some ice fishing supplies and L has been talking about Fleet Farm’s nuts for months so we made a trip to the burbs. We were in need of a tire rotation so did that while we were there as well. Smashed some Burger King before.

	Fleet Farm was packed. Looking at the fishing stuff was a bit daunting, I had never seen such a big supply. We both got piles, a couple tip ups, buckets, and a few other misc things. 

	We were so over shopping and people but we were already out so we ran the rest of our errands. L had to stop at Cub to get some ingredients for Gyoza (or goiyzies as she likes to say). We were next to target so we stopped in to look for new sheets but the selection was weak so we didn’t pull the trigger; we did leave with a little felt dog ornament that resembles Osker though so worth the trip.


	12/10 - Monday
	Playing: Rocket League
	Watching: Great British Bake Off

	Was feeling pretty jiggly from the weekend  so decided to start a fast. New RL season pass so naturally I had to get it. Played with David a bit. Found out he just got a new job at Ace as an assistant manager so he should be moving back here pretty soon and will be living with Olivia.

	12/11

	Day 1 fast was a success, woke up feeling more refreshed and lost some of the water weight. Shooting for 3 days but nights are tough so tbd. 

	I caved after 48 hours, had some of the spinach quiche I made since I was feeling pretty tired.

	12/12

	WFH. Started my day off at Spyhouse trying to finish up an online course of CSS grid. Took L to the bus stop and realized that our front right tire was at 12psi so I had to take care of that. Turns out it was just a faulty valve and not the tire so the dude didn’t even charge me, nice.

	Installed my Mac mini mount to the desk and moved over the raspberry pi, going to turn it into our plex media server.

	12/13
	Listening: Galapagos - Vonnegut

	Woke up at 2am to Gin coughing and couldn’t get back to sleep so I researched ice fishing for a few hours before getting ready for the day and getting into work at 7. Found a Navionics boating app that shows contours of all the lakes in the US so I started mapping out spots. I think first spot will be Eagle Lake or the one right by it, Pike Lake.

	Felt a little lighter today, going to have to be diligent about not caving this weekend.

	12/14

	Didn’t do shit after work. Sold my Xbox 360, bought some vodka (feck), played some video games. 

	12/15

	Spent the morning doing bills and organizing our credit card situation. 

	Went to uptown for a bloody at the Lowry and I got a salad.. my fast didn’t last very long. I got a Greek salad but holy shit it was citrusy.. I got a deviled egg on the side and that was delicious. It had some sweet relish on top and had a hint of curry. Yummm. Been a while since we brunches there, kind of miss that place, it’s so cozy.

	After brunch we tried to play pinball at Tilt but of course it was packed and we decided against it. I just so happened to look at the sign outside that listed their happy hour deals and L had to say “ You don’t need happy hour”. I didn’t take it so well and said “Oh, please. I don’t always need you telling me what to do”. She was visibly upset about that.. but it’s true. I could do without the comments.

	We didn’t really speak all the way to Bed Bath and Beyond where we finally found some new sheets and a duvet cover that we both really liked.. the awkwardness subsided and we checked out and made a second stop at play it again for some broom ball equipment.

	We stopped at BWW for food but realized it wasn’t happy hour and decided to go to Ray Jays in NE instead for some boneless wings; ultimately also got a juicy Lucy as well and it was surprisingly really good. No Matt’s but I have to say it was better than both of my Nook experiences.

	12/16

	Lacey’s colleague listed their house near Beltrami so we attended our first open house; so grown up of us. Upon walking up I saw that the mailbox said “Robson” and apparently her husbands name is Jon Robson.. what are the chances. The realtor made us a bloody and we wandered the house. It was nice, cute, but small. The storage space was minimal and true closet space was pretty much non existent. We decided it wasn’t right for us (even if we could afford it!). 

	Spyhouse for a couple coffees and a little walk over to the BluDot outlet.. the selection was disappointing but probably for the best since the last time we went we left having had made two couch purchases and a major dent in our wallets.

	We were getting hungry so we did Adelitas for a quick chips and queso snack and then checked out the international market on central. Tons of interesting food that I honestly have never seen before. We bought an onion.

	Not wanting to go home yet we decided to check out the Mermaid Bowling alley in Mounds View since we’ve been meaning to go. The bar was cozy with all natural wood and an array of xmas decorations and lights. We got some more wings (50c boneless on happy hour). They have a nice pinball selection and since Tilt was a flop we played for a bit.

	L and I steepes to a new reality tv low - 90 Day Fiancé. Sadly, it’s hilarious and we binge watched most of season 6.

	“Ohhhh no Colt-ie”

	12/17 - Mon

	Stayed home because I felt like it, called into a couple meetings but mostly just dicked around at home. Played some video games, cleaned a bit, etc.

	12/18 - Tues

	Work is becoming/has been so boring. I really don’t care about the product and the process here is shit. Not really great for my career advancement and am starting to feel like I did towards the end of my time at Capella. 

	Reached out to Angelina about US Bank to see if they are looking for hybrids, they are. Told her I might be getting ahold of her in the future.

	Finally fixed my Raspi internet connection. Seems like every time I make progress I break it again. The Plex server is up and running. Now I just need to figure out the firewall. Also thinking of installing a Tor browser because why not?

	12/19 - Wed

	Team lunch today at Crave. I got the King Kong roll, pretty good but $20. I had thought it was a company sponsored lunch but found out otherwise so not too thrilled about spending that on a sushi roll. 

	12/20

	Long ass day, my brain was fried by the end of it. Lacey had a long day too so we met up for HH at Moose for a couple. I got there before here and as I was waiting I bought a couple tickets for the meat raffle, and finally fn won for once! Picked out two giant sirloins. I feel like winning a meat raffle is a Minnesota right of passage.

	Came home and fried up some steaks and made L some fafeetas.

	12/21

	Had to present some work in the morning so woke up early and walked to work to mentally prepare. It didn’t go awesomely but could have been worse. The rest of my day is pretty chill so going to gym and then our team has a happy hour at Dan Kelly’s.

	Galena is having surgery today to remove a cancerous mass in her stomach.. apparently the surgery was donated to her by colleagues of Anton’s.

	Mom is going to Omaha for moral support and Dad is staying home, it’ll be their first xmas alone since they met.

	Super slow day at work, we all took off a little early for HH at Dan Kelly’s. Had a couple and talked to Spencer and Caleb; was warned about the woes of puppy life.

	Afterwards I met up with Korman, Matt, and David at Moose. Bought some weed for Lacey from Sam and Ronnie.

	“Do you guys think it’s 100% impossible for me to become a professional basketball player?” - Matt

	David had plans so dropped me off at home along with all the ice fishing stuff from dad and Korman, Matt, and I continued on to Able for a couple beers; we got there and there was a skating video premiere (Skating is Easy). It was pretty cool, had a good time. I smelled pretty skunk with a quarter of nugs in my pocket but I was surrounded by skaters so I felt rather unambiguous.

	12/22

	Drive to Iowa day. Got to Shaller around 4 or so. 

	Mark, Lori, L, and I did Smokin’ Hereford. We got the burger since they pride themselves in having the best in Iowa; it was not. It came overly charred and dry and Lori’s sirloin was somehow charred and far too rare.. The fries were good at least.

	12/23 - Sun

	Sioux City trip.

	12/24

	Took apart the elliptical machine upstairs and moved it to the basement. It ended up taking about two hours longer than I had guessed it would; it was frustrating but we got it down there and reassembled. 

	Kate came by for dinner, leftover soups and tacos and then we played some Tellistrations.

	Watched 7 Days to Go on Netflix.

	Packed up and made way before noon. It was snowing so we wanted to get back before hitting any weather. Listened to a few episodes of Teacher’s Lounge.

	Feeling fat af; going to have to diet and gym hard this week so I don’t blind anyone next week in the Bahamas!

	12/29

	Had a dream that was trying to take photos with the lens cap on.
